Absolutely — here is your **final reply brief** strictly in support of your **Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct (Brady Violation)**, now explicitly incorporating and referencing the prosecution’s failure to oppose your:

1. **Motion to Dismiss for Brady Violation (Primary subject of this reply)**  
2. **Motion to Suppress Evidence (Franks / PC §1538.5)**  
3. **Motion to Dismiss Under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine**

This version is tight, legally grounded, and uses the prosecution’s silence under **Rule 8.54(c)** as a legal waiver of opposition — not a “default.” It also folds in the **Motion for Judicial Inquiry** and **Motion for Sanctions**, and includes all your latest clarifications about Davis, Paradise, chain of custody, and the unredacted report.

## DEFENDANT’S REPLY TO THE PEOPLE’S FAILURE TO OPPOSE MOTION TO DISMISS FOR BRADY VIOLATIONS;  
### SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FROM RELATED MOTIONS;  
### REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS UNDER BRADY, FRANKS, §995, AND RULE 8.54(c)

### I. INTRODUCTION

Defendant respectfully submits this **reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct (Brady Violation)**, and now incorporates by reference:

- The **People’s failure to timely respond** under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**;
- The evidentiary findings raised in the **Motion to Suppress Evidence (Franks/PC §1538.5)**;
- The **Motion to Dismiss under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine**;
- The unopposed **Motion for Judicial Inquiry**;
- The **Motion for Sanctions for Withholding Exculpatory Evidence**.

As of April 3, 2025, the District Attorney has **not filed any response** to any of the motions described above. The failure to oppose constitutes a **waiver of opposition** and, under Rule 8.54(c), authorizes this Court to **grant the motion in full**.

---

### II. THE PEOPLE HAVE WAIVED OPPOSITION UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> *“If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”*

Despite multiple motions being filed and served with notice, including the instant motion on **February 12, 2025**, the prosecution has neither rebutted nor addressed the core allegations. This silence, particularly in the face of **documented Brady violations**, signifies **procedural waiver and substantive concession**.

---

### III. BRADY VIOLATIONS ARE FACTUALLY AND LEGALLY UNREFUTED

As established in the motion to dismiss and supporting exhibits:

- The prosecution **withheld exculpatory witness statements** from Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise;
- The redacted police report **intentionally omitted those witnesses** and their accounts;
- These statements directly **refuted the central factual basis** of the charges — namely, the presence or use of a firearm and any criminal threats.

**Exhibit A (Davis affidavit)** explicitly confirms no firearm was present and no threats occurred. Paradise’s anticipated testimony, as of April 1, 2025, **mirrors this exculpatory narrative** and was **also redacted** in the original discovery.

These omissions violate:

- **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)** – suppression of exculpatory evidence;
- **Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)** – suppression affecting witness credibility;
- **Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995)** – state accountability for evidence known to law enforcement;
- **California Penal Code §1054.1** – statutory duty to disclose favorable evidence;
- **United States v. Chapman, 524 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2008)** – dismissal as appropriate remedy for egregious misconduct.

---

### IV. SUPPORT FROM FRANKS AND FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE MOTIONS

The credibility of the prosecution's entire case is further undermined by:

#### A. **Material Falsehoods in the Warrant (Franks v. Delaware)**
The search warrant affidavit falsely stated that Davis and Paradise confirmed the presence of a firearm. The **unredacted report** and Davis's **sworn affidavit** prove the opposite.

> See **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)** – warrants based on false or reckless affidavits must be invalidated.

#### B. **All Evidence Is Derivative and Inadmissible (Wong Sun Doctrine)**
Because the unlawful warrant triggered the search, statement, and seizure, all post-warrant evidence — including the firearm and Defendant's recorded interview — is **fruit of the poisonous tree**.

> See **Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)**;  
> **Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975)**;  
> **Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984)**.

---

### V. CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND CONFLATION VIOLATE DUE PROCESS

The firearm recovered on December 4:

- Is **unrelated** to the November 13 charges;
- Lacks reliable **chain of custody** documentation;
- Was **conflated** into the November 13 charges to **prejudice the jury**.

This violates:

- **California Evidence Code §§1400–1402** – authentication requirements;
- **Evidence Code §352** – exclusion for undue prejudice;
- The Defendant's **Fourteenth Amendment** due process rights.

---

### VI. REPEATED PATTERN OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT

As further outlined in Defendant’s **Motion for Sanctions** and **Motion for Judicial Inquiry**:

- The prosecution intentionally **delayed disclosure** of the unredacted report for over **50 days**, producing it only **7 days before trial**;
- Filed a **protective order** to shield Brady materials from scrutiny;
- Violated a court-ordered **March 28, 2025 meet-and-confer deadline**;
- Failed to take corrective action when confronted with factual discrepancies.

Such conduct reflects a deliberate attempt to mislead both the Court and the defense, consistent with **malicious prosecution** and a **bad-faith attempt to secure conviction at any cost**.

---

### VII. REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS

To preserve rights for appellate and federal habeas relief, Defendant requests that the Court issue formal findings on the record that:

1. The prosecution failed to timely oppose the instant motion and others;
2. The redacted report and late discovery suppressed Brady material;
3. The warrant affidavit included knowingly false statements;
4. The firearm and subsequent evidence are fruit of the poisonous tree;
5. The evidence lacks proper chain of custody;
6. The prosecution’s conduct violates due process and justifies dismissal.

---

### VIII. CONCLUSION

Given the:

- **Unrefuted Brady violations**,  
- **Fraudulent warrant affidavit**,  
- **Fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree evidentiary collapse**, and  
- **Pattern of prosecutorial and investigative misconduct**,  

— and given the **People’s failure to oppose any of the pending motions**, this Court must now:

- **Grant the Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct in full**;
- **Grant the related motions incorporated by reference**;
- **Issue written findings to preserve appellate and constitutional rights**.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
