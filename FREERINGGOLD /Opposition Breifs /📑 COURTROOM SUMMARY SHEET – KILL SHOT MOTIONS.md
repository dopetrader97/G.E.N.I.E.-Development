## 🔍 **KEY VIOLATIONS TO HIGHLIGHT**

- **Franks Violation:** False or reckless warrant affidavit (claimed witness corroboration that did not exist).
- **Miranda/Due Process Violations:** No waiver, no transcript, repeated coercion invoked.
- **Judicial Bias:** DA given 51 days to respond; defense given 4. Multiple denials without findings.
- **Chain of Custody Gaps:** No logs for firearm or video, both presented as if properly authenticated.

## 🧠 **ORAL ARGUMENT STRUCTURE – INTEGRATED SUMMARY**

### **I. Open with Constitutional Frame**  
- "This case is built on concealed evidence, a tainted warrant, and a coerced statement."

### **II. Kill Shot Argument Structure**

2. Franks + §1538.5 – false affidavit = invalid warrant
3. Fruit of the Poisonous Tree – dismissal due to tainted investigation
4. Coerced Statement – inadmissible under *Jackson v. Denno*, *Miranda*, *People v. Neal*
5. Chain of Custody – EC §§1400–1402

### **III. Relief Demanded**
- Dismissal under PC §995
- Suppression of all evidence under Franks & 1538.5
- Exclusion of coerced statement
- Trial stay based on prejudice and judicial bias
- Written judicial findings preserved for appeal and habeas
