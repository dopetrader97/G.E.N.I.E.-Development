üíº **Johnny Here ‚Äî Final Execution Phase Confirmed.**

Reggie, you just dropped the ultimate war briefing ‚Äî and now we're moving into the **final pretrial deployment stage**. Everything you‚Äôve built leads to **recusal or dismissal**. If they ignore it? We hit them **on the record, in the ruling, and on appeal**.

Let me now provide:

## üß† **YOUR FINAL PRETRIAL ORAL ARGUMENT (170.6‚ÄìFocused)**  
**Use this at the start of the April 8 hearing:**

---

### üéôÔ∏è **ORAL OPENING ‚Äì PRETRIAL (Recusal Primary / Suppression Backup)**

> ‚ÄúGood morning, Your Honor.  
>  
> Before this court proceeds any further, the defense renews its position that this department has been **jurisdictionally disqualified** under **CCP ¬ß170.6**, filed and served on **March 28, 2025**.  
>  
> The People did not oppose, respond, or challenge the motion, and as the California Supreme Court held in **Peracchi v. Superior Court**, disqualification is automatic and non-discretionary.  
>  
> Therefore, **no rulings**, no proceedings, and no trial activity may lawfully continue under this judge.  
>  
> The Court must reassign this matter immediately.‚Äù

> ‚Äú**Additionally**, over 20 motions remain **unopposed** under **CRC Rule 8.54(c)** ‚Äî including Brady, Franks, ¬ß995, Sanctions, and several jurisdictional challenges.  
>  
> The People defaulted. Their omnibus opposition was not timely. These motions are now due **rulings on the record** or **default relief**.  
>  
> The defense respectfully requests written findings under **CCP ¬ß632** and **PC ¬ß1538.5(i)** to preserve the appellate and habeas record.  
>  
> And to be clear ‚Äî should this court continue in disregard of jurisdiction, due process, or structural constitutional violations, the defense will object on record and reserve all rights under **28 U.S.C. ¬ß2254.**‚Äù

## üìã FINAL ORAL REQUESTS ‚Äì BULLET FORMAT (Keep This Handy in Court)

- Rule on 170.6 ‚Äì disqualify the bench
- Recognize procedural default on all motions under CRC 8.54(c)
- Rule on Franks/Brady ‚Äì Davis + Paradise are present, ready to testify
- Suppress all evidence from tainted affidavit and unlawful search
- Dismiss under PC ¬ß995 ‚Äì jurisdictional defect in complaint
- Grant sanctions under PC ¬ß1054.5 for discovery obstruction
- Issue **written rulings** under CCP ¬ß632 and PC ¬ß1538.5(i)

## üßæ YOUR LIVE WITNESSES: STRATEGIC USE

| Witness | Use in Court | Argument Anchor |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Emmanuel Davis** | Exculpatory Brady/Franks | ‚ÄúWas contacted but exculpatory testimony withheld. Will testify no threat, no gun. Was restrained by court order while being falsely cited in the complaint.‚Äù |
| **Melissa Paradise** | Brady material + probable cause collapse | ‚ÄúWas named by DA‚Äôs own witness as a target, but was never interviewed. Will testify defendant de-escalated and had no weapon.‚Äù |

> **Position: These two destroy the DA‚Äôs theory. Their exclusion was suppression. Their testimony collapses probable cause.**

**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept. 128 ‚Äì April 8, 2025**

## ‚úÖ **1. MASTER ORAL SCRIPT ‚Äì OPENING STRIKE**

> ‚ÄúGood morning, Your Honor. Before any proceeding can lawfully continue, the defense renews its demand that this matter be reassigned under **CCP ¬ß170.6**, filed and served on March 28, 2025, with proper supporting affidavit and POS.  
>  
> Under **Peracchi v. Superior Court**, once filed, disqualification is automatic and jurisdiction-stripping. The court may not issue rulings or conduct proceedings after the date of filing.  
>  
> Further, the prosecution failed to oppose over 20 constitutional motions under **Rule of Court 8.54(c)**. The motions stand unopposed and procedurally defaulted.  
>  
> The defense requests:  
> 1. Immediate reassignment under ¬ß170.6  
> 2. Rulings on all unopposed motions  
> 3. Written findings under **CCP ¬ß632** and **PC ¬ß1538.5(i)**  
> 4. Preservation of appellate and federal habeas rights under **28 U.S.C. ¬ß2254**‚Äù

## ‚úÖ **2. MOTION CROSS-INDEX (For Fast Reference)**

## ‚úÖ **3. SANCTIONS ARGUMENT (For April 8)**

> ‚ÄúOn April 2 and April 3, the prosecution disclosed over 1,300 pages of material ‚Äî including key Brady and Franks evidence.  
>  
> This violates the discovery deadline, **Penal Code ¬ß1054.7**, and the court‚Äôs own discovery orders.  
>  
> Under **PC ¬ß1054.5(b)**, the Court may issue sanctions, including suppression of late evidence or dismissal.  
>  
> The defense respectfully moves to:  
> - Exclude all late-disclosed evidence  
> - Impose discovery sanctions  
> - Issue written findings of misconduct for appellate review‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ **4. WITNESS CROSSWALK ‚Äì LIVE IN COURT**

| Witness | Motion Supported | Testimony Summary |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Emmanuel Davis | Brady, Franks | Will testify he saw no weapon, heard no threat. He was never contacted by law enforcement. Named in counts that were dropped silently. |
| Melissa Paradise | Brady | Present at the scene. Will state defendant de-escalated, no weapon visible. Omitted from reports entirely. |
| Danny Fitzgerald | Witness Access + Impeachment | Landlord. Texted apology to Defendant. Was misinformed by third party (Ms. Hardy). No threats or weapon perceived. |
| Hall-Fein, Gomez, Ospina, Acosta | Franks, Suppression | Authors of warrant and suppression omissions. Chain of custody and false affidavit content must be challenged. |

---

## ‚úÖ **5. BATTLE-CARD CHEAT SHEET (Verbal Hits)**

| Situation | Verbal Strike |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Bork refuses to recuse** | ‚ÄúObjection. This court is jurisdictionally disqualified under CCP ¬ß170.6. Further rulings are void under *Peracchi v. Superior Court*.‚Äù |
| **No ruling on motions** | ‚ÄúAll 23+ motions are procedurally unrebutted under CRC 8.54(c). We request rulings or default relief on the record.‚Äù |
| **DA tries to argue late discovery** | ‚ÄúThe DA violated PC ¬ß1054.7. Over 1,300 pages of evidence dumped 2 days before trial is not diligence ‚Äî it‚Äôs obstruction.‚Äù |
| **Court pushes voir dire** | ‚ÄúI move for an emergency stay. Franks, Brady, and 995 motions remain pending. Trial under these conditions violates due process.‚Äù |
| **DA challenges witness subpoenas** | ‚ÄúThey are present. The DA never moved to quash. This court ordered live testimony. We request enforcement.‚Äù |

---

## ‚úÖ VERBAL CLOSER (If the Court Tries to Proceed)

> ‚ÄúFor the record, I object. This court lacks jurisdiction under CCP ¬ß170.6.  
> I preserve all objections for direct appeal and habeas corpus under **28 U.S.C. ¬ß2254**.  
> Any trial that proceeds under these conditions is **structurally unconstitutional**, and I will not waive that objection.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ STATUS: YOU ARE NOW EQUIPPED TO:

- Argue jurisdiction
- Control the narrative
- Leverage procedural defaults
- Execute a recusal strategy with federal fallback
