## 🧠 **YOUR FINAL PRETRIAL ORAL ARGUMENT (170.6–Focused)**  
**Use this at the start of the April 8 hearing:**

### 🎙️ **ORAL OPENING – PRETRIAL (Recusal Primary / Suppression Backup)**

> “Good morning, Your Honor.  
>  
> Before this court proceeds any further, the defense renews its position that this department has been **jurisdictionally disqualified** under **CCP §170.6**, filed and served on **March 28, 2025**.  
>  
> The People did not oppose, respond, or challenge the motion, and as the California Supreme Court held in **Peracchi v. Superior Court**, disqualification is automatic and non-discretionary.  
>  
> Therefore, **no rulings**, no proceedings, and no trial activity may lawfully continue under this judge.  
>  
> The Court must reassign this matter immediately.”

> “**Additionally**, over 20 motions remain **unopposed** under **CRC Rule 8.54(c)** — including Brady, Franks, §995, Sanctions, and several jurisdictional challenges.  
>  
> The People defaulted. Their omnibus opposition was not timely. These motions are now due **rulings on the record** or **default relief**.  
>  
> The defense respectfully requests written findings under **CCP §632** and **PC §1538.5(i)** to preserve the appellate and habeas record.  
>  
> And to be clear — should this court continue in disregard of jurisdiction, due process, or structural constitutional violations, the defense will object on record and reserve all rights under **28 U.S.C. §2254.**”

## 📋 FINAL ORAL REQUESTS – BULLET FORMAT (Keep This Handy in Court)

- Rule on 170.6 – disqualify the bench
- Recognize procedural default on all motions under CRC 8.54(c)
- Rule on Franks/Brady – Davis + Paradise are present, ready to testify
- Suppress all evidence from tainted affidavit and unlawful search
- Dismiss under PC §995 – jurisdictional defect in complaint
- Grant sanctions under PC §1054.5 for discovery obstruction
- Issue **written rulings** under CCP §632 and PC §1538.5(i)

## 🧾 YOUR LIVE WITNESSES: STRATEGIC USE

| Witness | Use in Court | Argument Anchor |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Emmanuel Davis** | Exculpatory Brady/Franks | “Was contacted but exculpatory testimony withheld. Will testify no threat, no gun. Was restrained by court order while being falsely cited in the complaint.” |
| **Melissa Paradise** | Brady material + probable cause collapse | “Was named by DA’s own witness as a target, but was never interviewed. Will testify defendant de-escalated and had no weapon.” |

> **Position: These two destroy the DA’s theory. Their exclusion was suppression. Their testimony collapses probable cause.**

### ⚠️ WHAT IF THEY IGNORE 170.6?

You immediately say:

> “I respectfully object. **This department is jurisdictionally disqualified.**  
> Any ruling made is void and will be challenged via writ and habeas corpus under **28 U.S.C. §2254**. I preserve all objections for higher review.”

Then request:
- Stay of trial
- Ruling on written findings
- Transcript for writ filing

# 📚 **SUPPRESSION + RECUSAL ORAL ARGUMENT BINDER**  
**Lead Counsel: Reginald Rothschild**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept. 128 – April 8, 2025**

---

## ✅ **1. MASTER ORAL SCRIPT – OPENING STRIKE**

> “Good morning, Your Honor. Before any proceeding can lawfully continue, the defense renews its demand that this matter be reassigned under **CCP §170.6**, filed and served on March 28, 2025, with proper supporting affidavit and POS.  
>  
> Under **Peracchi v. Superior Court**, once filed, disqualification is automatic and jurisdiction-stripping. The court may not issue rulings or conduct proceedings after the date of filing.  
>  
> Further, the prosecution failed to oppose over 20 constitutional motions under **Rule of Court 8.54(c)**. The motions stand unopposed and procedurally defaulted.  
>  
> The defense requests:  
> 1. Immediate reassignment under §170.6  
> 2. Rulings on all unopposed motions  
> 3. Written findings under **CCP §632** and **PC §1538.5(i)**  
> 4. Preservation of appellate and federal habeas rights under **28 U.S.C. §2254**”

## ✅ **2. MOTION CROSS-INDEX (For Fast Reference)**

| Category | Motion | Goal |
|----------|--------|------|
| Judicial Bias | Motion to Dismiss + §170.6 | Recusal of Bork, void all rulings post-March 28 |
| Probable Cause | Motion to Dismiss (Demurrer) + §995 | Collapse charging docs |
| Suppression | Brady, Franks, 1538.5 | Suppress firearm, warrant, video statement |
| Sanctions | Motion for Sanctions (PC §1054.5) | Punish DA for 1,300+ late pages |
| Testimony | Motion to Compel Davis & Paradise | Get exculpatory witnesses in open court |
| Quash Warrant | Franks + Motion to Quash | Destroy poisoned tree root |
| Written Rulings | Motion for CCP §632 Findings | Lock in appeal record |

---

## ✅ **3. SANCTIONS ARGUMENT (For April 8)**

> “On April 2 and April 3, the prosecution disclosed over 1,300 pages of material — including key Brady and Franks evidence.  
>  
> This violates the discovery deadline, **Penal Code §1054.7**, and the court’s own discovery orders.  
>  
> Under **PC §1054.5(b)**, the Court may issue sanctions, including suppression of late evidence or dismissal.  
>  
> The defense respectfully moves to:  
> - Exclude all late-disclosed evidence  
> - Impose discovery sanctions  
> - Issue written findings of misconduct for appellate review”

---

## ✅ **4. WITNESS CROSSWALK – LIVE IN COURT**

| Witness | Motion Supported | Testimony Summary |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Emmanuel Davis | Brady, Franks | Will testify he saw no weapon, heard no threat. He was never contacted by law enforcement. Named in counts that were dropped silently. |
| Melissa Paradise | Brady | Present at the scene. Will state defendant de-escalated, no weapon visible. Omitted from reports entirely. |
| Danny Fitzgerald | Witness Access + Impeachment | Landlord. Texted apology to Defendant. Was misinformed by third party (Ms. Hardy). No threats or weapon perceived. |
| Hall-Fein, Gomez, Ospina, Acosta | Franks, Suppression | Authors of warrant and suppression omissions. Chain of custody and false affidavit content must be challenged. |

---

## ✅ **5. BATTLE-CARD CHEAT SHEET (Verbal Hits)**

| Situation | Verbal Strike |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Bork refuses to recuse** | “Objection. This court is jurisdictionally disqualified under CCP §170.6. Further rulings are void under *Peracchi v. Superior Court*.” |
| **No ruling on motions** | “All 23+ motions are procedurally unrebutted under CRC 8.54(c). We request rulings or default relief on the record.” |
| **DA tries to argue late discovery** | “The DA violated PC §1054.7. Over 1,300 pages of evidence dumped 2 days before trial is not diligence — it’s obstruction.” |
| **Court pushes voir dire** | “I move for an emergency stay. Franks, Brady, and 995 motions remain pending. Trial under these conditions violates due process.” |
| **DA challenges witness subpoenas** | “They are present. The DA never moved to quash. This court ordered live testimony. We request enforcement.” |

---

## ✅ VERBAL CLOSER (If the Court Tries to Proceed)

> “For the record, I object. This court lacks jurisdiction under CCP §170.6.  
> I preserve all objections for direct appeal and habeas corpus under **28 U.S.C. §2254**.  
> Any trial that proceeds under these conditions is **structurally unconstitutional**, and I will not waive that objection.”

---

### ✅ STATUS: YOU ARE NOW EQUIPPED TO:

- Argue jurisdiction
- Control the narrative
- Leverage procedural defaults
- Execute a recusal strategy with federal fallback
