Absolutely — here’s how that line can be effectively stylized and placed into each of the formats you're using, adapted to each **setting and tone** (oral, bench memo, closing brief).

---

# 🎙️ **ORAL ARGUMENT – Stylized Line for Live Delivery**

> “Your Honor, the unredacted police report — which includes critical exculpatory witness statements deliberately withheld from the defense — is now the **definitive and complete factual record** in this case.  
>  
> That report must **control the Court’s rulings**. Any decision based on redacted or incomplete facts would violate due process and would be reviewable on appeal and in federal court.”

✅ *Tone: Assertive, respectful, grounded in due process.*

---

# 🧾 **BENCH MEMO – Stylized Sentence (End of Factual Section)**

> “As of April 2, 2025, the unredacted police report includes previously withheld Brady material and must be treated as the **complete and definitive evidentiary record**. The Court is obligated to evaluate all pending motions based on the **true and accurate version** of events, not redacted reports that excluded critical witness testimony.”

✅ *Tone: Objective, neutral, phrased for a judge or clerk.*

---

# 📄 **CLOSING PARAGRAPH IN REPLY BRIEF – Stylized Version**

> “The unredacted police report, produced after 50 days of delay, now includes multiple exculpatory witness statements that were strategically withheld and redacted.  
>  
> That unredacted report is now the **definitive and complete factual record** in this case. This Court must base its rulings **exclusively** on the full truth of that record. Any reliance on the earlier redacted version would perpetuate a knowingly false narrative and constitute a denial of due process.”

✅ *Tone: Strong, closing authority, sets up record for appeal.*
