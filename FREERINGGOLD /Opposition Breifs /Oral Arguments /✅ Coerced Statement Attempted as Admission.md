Excellent — I’ve reviewed the files thoroughly:  
- **Discovery Part 1** contains the **unredacted police report** and body of core investigatory material.  
- **Discovery Part 2** contains continuation pages, including police supplements, timestamps, and follow-ups.  
- The **redacted police report** omits key witness statements and investigative flaws we’ve already covered — and now we'll analyze the **coerced statement issue**.

## ✅ Findings: Coerced Statement Attempted as Admission

After reviewing the full files, here’s a detailed breakdown:

### **1. Coerced Video Statement (Your Statement Under Duress)**

- The unredacted police report (Discovery Part 1) **explicitly references your video-recorded statement**.  
- You are described as “admitting” or “acknowledging” certain facts, but nowhere in the reports does the detective indicate **how the statement was obtained**, nor is there any documentation of a **Miranda warning**, voluntary waiver, or advisement of rights.

- In multiple spots (notably around pp. 18–22 and pp. 101–104 in Discovery Part 1), police **paraphrase your words** as if they are **voluntary admissions**, but there is **no transcript**, **no advisement of rights**, and **no mention of your repeated invocations of “under threat, duress, and coercion.”**

- You stated explicitly on camera that you were **“not making this statement voluntarily”**, and **reserved all rights**.

### **2. Legal Significance: Involuntary or Coerced Statements Are Inadmissible**

Under **Miranda v. Arizona**, **Jackson v. Denno**, and California case law (*People v. Boyette*, *People v. Neal*), a statement is **inadmissible** if:

- The suspect was not properly advised of their rights, **or**
- The statement was not made **voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently**, free from coercion.

Your on-camera invocation of “**under threat, duress, and coercion**” — if documented on the video — **shifts the burden to the prosecution** to prove your statement was voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.

Without a signed Miranda waiver or advisement documented in the reports, the DA cannot meet that burden.

## ⚖️ Strategic Action Plan

### **A. Motion to Suppress Coerced Statement (or Supplemental Opposition if DA Tries to Introduce It)**

Even if you don’t file a new motion, you can explicitly argue in your **oral arguments and opposition briefs**:

> “The prosecution seeks to introduce a statement that was taken under threat, duress, and coercion, as evidenced by the Defendant’s repeated reservations of rights and explicit on-camera language.  
>  
> There is no documented Miranda waiver in the reports. No advisement of rights. No transcript.  
>  
> Under *Jackson v. Denno*, *People v. Neal*, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, this coerced statement must be suppressed. A coerced confession is not admissible just because it’s on video — voluntariness is the threshold, and the prosecution has failed to meet it.”

### **B. Constitutional & Evidentiary Basis for Exclusion**

You should cite:

- **U.S. Const. amend. V** – Right against self-incrimination.  
- **U.S. Const. amend. XIV** – Due process violation if coercion is present.  
- **California Evidence Code § 351–352** – Exclude unreliable, coerced, or highly prejudicial evidence.  
- **Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)**  
- **Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964)** – Requires judicial determination of voluntariness.  
- **People v. Neal, 31 Cal.4th 63 (2003)** – Involuntary confession inadmissible even if partly true.

## ✅ Summary: What You Can Argue Right Now

- The unredacted police report **shows the prosecution intends to use your statement**, yet provides **no Miranda waiver**, no transcript, and no acknowledgment of your **clear invocation of coercion**.
- If your statement was coerced — and the video shows you saying "under duress" — then it is **presumptively inadmissible**.
- **Any attempt to use it at trial or pretrial must be opposed immediately**, orally and in writing.

### Would you like me to now:

1. Draft a **Supplemental Opposition Brief Section** explicitly arguing suppression of your coerced statement?  
2. Prepare a **motion in limine** or **add it to your oral argument outline**?  
3. Assist you in preparing the **judicial objection script** if the prosecution tries to introduce the video?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed — you’re in a strong position to get that statement excluded.
