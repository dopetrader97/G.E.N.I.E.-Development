Crystal clear — and you're absolutely right to keep your oral argument lean, aggressive, and **defensively reactive** on this point. You don’t want to give the prosecution any implied foundation for a coerced “admission” unless they raise it themselves.

So here’s what we’ll do:

1. I’ll prepare your **oral argument outline for Version C**, now updated to include the coerced statement issue as a **conditional counterargument** (only if the DA raises it).
2. I’ll **explicitly identify** the paraphrased statements in the unredacted police report (pp. 18–22 and 101–104) that could be interpreted as “admissions,” so you **don’t repeat or legitimize them**.
3. Later, when you're ready, we can revise Version C of the brief to incorporate the coerced testimony suppression, as you mentioned.

## ✅ ORAL ARGUMENT OUTLINE — Version C  
**Updated: Coerced Statement Defense (If Raised by DA)**  
*(Courtroom-Ready, Reactive Strategy)*

---

## **🟨 I. Opening Theme (1–2 Minutes)**

> “Your Honor, the District Attorney’s opposition does not change the constitutional reality:  
>  
> This case continues to rest on redacted witness statements, a warrant built on false representations, and now — potentially — a **coerced, manipulated statement attributed to me**.  
>  
> If the Court permits any of this to proceed unchallenged, it would not just reward constitutional violations — it would legitimize them. And that strikes at the heart of due process.”

---

## **🟥 II. Core Violations (Reinforced)**

### **A. Brady – Still Unrebutted**
> “They continue to ignore the intentional redactions of Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise. These are not clerical errors. These are deliberate acts that concealed exculpatory evidence until the last moment.  
>  
> That is the essence of a **Brady violation**, and no amount of post hoc explanation rewrites that history.”

### **B. Franks – Warrant Still Invalid**
> “The affidavit claimed witnesses corroborated a firearm — but those same witnesses denied any such thing.  
>  
> *Franks v. Delaware* demands suppression. The DA doesn’t deny the contradiction — they just hope the Court overlooks it.”

### **C. Chain of Custody – Still Missing**
> “No timestamped logs. No forensic links. No evidentiary connection to the actual incident.  
>  
> That weapon is not relevant. It’s prejudicial, unauthenticated, and must be excluded.”

---

## **🟧 III. Conditional Argument (Only If DA Raises Statement or Video)**

### **D. Coerced Statement – Constitutionally Inadmissible**

> “If the District Attorney seeks to introduce any part of my recorded statement — I must object immediately.  
>  
> There is **no documented Miranda waiver**, **no advisement of rights**, and **no transcript** in the discovery or police reports.  
>  
> And more importantly, I made it explicitly clear — on camera — that my responses were made **under threat, duress, and coercion**, and that I **reserved all rights** at every step.  
>  
> If the video omits those invocations, then it has been **chopped and altered**, which is why the chain of custody of that evidence becomes central to this hearing.  
>  
> Under *Miranda v. Arizona*, *Jackson v. Denno*, and *People v. Neal*, any statement obtained through coercion is presumptively inadmissible — regardless of content.  
>  
> If the prosecution intends to use that video, the burden is on them to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statement was voluntary.  
>  
> And they can’t — because they never documented a waiver, never advised me of my rights, and never acknowledged my explicit objection during questioning.”

---

## **🟥 IV. Relief Requested**

> “Based on the continuing Brady and Franks violations, the chain-of-custody failures, and any attempt to introduce a coerced statement, I respectfully request the Court to:”

- Grant dismissal under **Penal Code §995**;  
- Suppress all evidence obtained via the faulty warrant (**Franks**);  
- Exclude the December 4 firearm under **Evidence Code §§1400–1402** and **§352**;  
- Preclude the use of **any recorded statement**, unless the prosecution can establish **voluntariness and chain of custody** through admissible evidence;  
- Issue **written findings** on each ruling to preserve the record for appellate and habeas review.

---

## 🚨 V. Judicial Bias Preservation (Same as Prior Versions)

> “And finally, Your Honor, I must again respectfully preserve the record.  
>  
> My **CCP §170.6 motion** was timely and remains unruled. If the Court proceeds to ignore the documented Brady suppression, the Franks violations, or the coerced statement without findings, that constitutes bias and due process denial.  
>  
> I request written rulings on all major points — especially any denial of suppression — for appellate preservation.”

---

## ✅ Specific Police Report Language (So You *Do Not* Reference It)

These are paraphrased lines (Discovery Part 1, pp. 18–22 and 101–104) that the prosecution may try to characterize as admissions. **Do not mention these yourself unless the DA raises them:**

**Important:**  
These are **not direct quotes**, they are **detective summaries** — and you have **every right to challenge their reliability** if the DA relies on them. If they try to treat these summaries as “admissions,” you can say:

> “Those are not verbatim statements. They are investigator paraphrases. And if the actual video or transcript doesn’t contain that language — then the report is misleading, and the statement was both coerced and misrepresented.”

---

✅ You’re now fully armed for oral argument.
