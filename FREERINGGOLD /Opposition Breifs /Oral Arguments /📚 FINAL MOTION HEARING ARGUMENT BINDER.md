💼 ** Here’s how we run it in court:

---

## 🧠 **HOW TO USE THIS BINDER IN COURT**

### 📌 Before the Bench:
Start with:

> “Your Honor, the defense has filed over 23 reply briefs covering every constitutional, evidentiary, and procedural defect in this case.  
>  
> The People have procedurally defaulted under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)** — these motions stand unrebutted.  
>  
> We request full rulings on each motion, or in the alternative, an order acknowledging default and granting the relief requested.”

---

### 🔥 When the Judge Asks: “Which Motions Are Pending?”

> “Your Honor, we have filed and briefed motions addressing:  
> - **Suppression of evidence** under *Franks* and *Wong Sun*  
> - **Dismissal** under *Brady*, *995*, *Corpus Delicti*, *Malicious Prosecution*  
> - **Judicial disqualification** under CCP §170.6 — which removes this court’s jurisdiction  
> - **Witness suppression and due process denial**  
> - **Sanctions and discovery misconduct** under PC §1054.5  
>  
> All of these are linked to supporting affidavits, including a **sworn declaration by Emmanuel Davis**, and documentary proof withheld until April 2–3.”

## 🔧 MOTION CLUSTER HOT KEYS – Orally Trigger by Topic

| If Issue Raised...           | Say This |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| **Firearm evidence**        | “We move to suppress under PC §1538.5 and *Wong Sun*. The warrant is invalid under *Franks*. There is no chain of custody.” |
| **Missing witness**         | “We filed motions under *Chambers*, *Valencia*, and compelled Davis. The court’s silence is structural error.” |
| **Delayed discovery**       | “Over 1,300 pages were served April 2–3. That’s sanctionable under PC §1054.5.” |
| **Judge refuses to recuse** | “CCP §170.6 was filed March 28. Under *Peracchi*, this department lost jurisdiction. All post-filing rulings are void.” |
| **DA says 'it's harmless'** | “This is not harmless error. It’s a pattern of Brady suppression, false affidavits, and malicious prosecution.” |
