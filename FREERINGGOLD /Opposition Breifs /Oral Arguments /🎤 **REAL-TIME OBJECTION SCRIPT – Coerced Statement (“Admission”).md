# 🎤 **REAL-TIME OBJECTION SCRIPT – Coerced Statement (“Admission”) Raised in Court**

If the DA refers to any paraphrased statement (e.g., “the Defendant acknowledged…”), use this verbatim or slightly adjusted:

---

### 🔔 **“Objection, Your Honor — Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Violation.”**

> “Your Honor, I object to the People’s use of this alleged admission.  
>  
> First, there is **no Miranda waiver on record**, no advisement of rights, no signed acknowledgment, and no transcript to verify what I actually said.  
>  
> Second, I explicitly stated — on video — that **I was responding under threat, duress, and coercion**, and **reserved all rights** at every step.  
>  
> Third, the prosecution has failed to lay any foundation for **voluntariness**, as required under **Miranda v. Arizona**, **Jackson v. Denno**, and **People v. Neal**.  
>  
> If the People intend to introduce any statement, they must first establish — beyond a reasonable doubt — that it was given freely and voluntarily. They cannot do that, and therefore, the statement must be excluded.”

✅ Bonus Tip (if they push back with the “but it’s on video” argument):

> “Your Honor, if the video **omits my invocation of coercion** or my statements reserving all rights, then the video itself has been **edited or selectively manipulated**, and is inadmissible under **Evidence Code §§1400 and 352**. The burden is on the prosecution to prove chain of custody and completeness — and they have not done so.”
