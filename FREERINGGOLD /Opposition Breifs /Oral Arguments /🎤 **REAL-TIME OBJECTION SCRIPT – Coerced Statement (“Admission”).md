Perfect — let’s knock this out clean and tight.

First, I’ll revise **Version C** of your **Opposition Brief** to include the **coerced statement suppression argument** as a full new section, seamlessly integrated. Then, I’ll give you a **real-time courtroom objection script** so you’re fully armed if the DA tries to use any paraphrased “admissions” in court.

# 🧾 **REVISED OPPOSITION BRIEF – VERSION C**  
### *Now Including Coerced Statement Suppression Argument*

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**[Your Full Name]**,  
Defendant.  

Case No.: [Case Number]  
Dept.: [Department]  
Judge: [Judge's Name]  

**DEFENDANT’S REPLY TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S SUBSTANTIVE OPPOSITION TO PENDING MOTIONS; REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS**

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

The District Attorney’s opposition fails to overcome the constitutional and evidentiary violations at the core of this prosecution:  
- **Suppressed exculpatory witness statements** (Brady violations);  
- **False and misleading affidavit language** used to obtain a warrant (Franks violation);  
- **Unreliable chain of custody for physical evidence**; and  
- A **coerced, improperly obtained statement** from the Defendant, now improperly framed as a voluntary admission.

The People’s response relies on post hoc rationalizations and omits any documentation demonstrating that proper procedures were followed during interrogation or evidence handling. This Court must not condone misconduct by omission.

---

### II. **COERCED STATEMENT MUST BE SUPPRESSED – FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION**

The prosecution has referenced statements allegedly made by Defendant during a video-recorded interview. These statements are paraphrased in multiple portions of the police report (e.g., pages 18–22, 101–104 of Discovery Part 1), yet the following is **undisputed**:

- **No Miranda advisement is documented** in any police report;
- **No waiver of rights was signed or referenced**;
- **No transcript** of the recorded statement has been produced;
- **No chain of custody documentation** has been provided for the video; and
- Defendant **repeatedly stated on video** that all responses were given **under threat, duress, and coercion**, and explicitly **reserved all rights**.

If the District Attorney attempts to use that video or its paraphrased contents as a voluntary admission, the statement must be suppressed. Under:

- **Fifth Amendment** (right against self-incrimination),
- **Fourteenth Amendment** (due process),
- **Miranda v. Arizona**, 384 U.S. 436 (1966),
- **Jackson v. Denno**, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), and
- **People v. Neal**, 31 Cal.4th 63 (2003),

...a confession is **inadmissible unless proven to be voluntary**, and the prosecution has not — and cannot — meet that burden here.

If the recording omits Defendant’s invocation of coercion, then the evidence has been **altered or selectively edited**, further supporting suppression under **California Evidence Code §§1400–1402** and **§352**.

---

### III. **(Rest of Brief Continues – Brady, Franks, Chain of Custody, Prosecutorial Misconduct)**  
*No changes needed to these sections. The rest of Version C remains fully intact.*

---

### IV. **CONCLUSION (Updated)**

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant the Motion to Dismiss** pursuant to **Penal Code §995**;  
2. **Suppress all evidence obtained via the invalid warrant** under **Franks v. Delaware**;  
3. **Exclude the December 4 firearm** under **Evidence Code §§1400–1402** and **§352**;  
4. **Suppress the coerced video statement**, or any derivative evidence, as obtained in violation of **Miranda**, the **Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments**, and **Jackson v. Denno**;  
5. **Deny the People’s Motion for Protective Order**;  
6. **Issue written findings** on each of the constitutional and evidentiary grounds raised.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**[Your Name]**  
Defendant In Pro Per (or counsel of record)

# 🎤 **REAL-TIME OBJECTION SCRIPT – Coerced Statement (“Admission”) Raised in Court**

If the DA refers to any paraphrased statement (e.g., “the Defendant acknowledged…”), use this verbatim or slightly adjusted:

---

### 🔔 **“Objection, Your Honor — Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Violation.”**

> “Your Honor, I object to the People’s use of this alleged admission.  
>  
> First, there is **no Miranda waiver on record**, no advisement of rights, no signed acknowledgment, and no transcript to verify what I actually said.  
>  
> Second, I explicitly stated — on video — that **I was responding under threat, duress, and coercion**, and **reserved all rights** at every step.  
>  
> Third, the prosecution has failed to lay any foundation for **voluntariness**, as required under **Miranda v. Arizona**, **Jackson v. Denno**, and **People v. Neal**.  
>  
> If the People intend to introduce any statement, they must first establish — beyond a reasonable doubt — that it was given freely and voluntarily. They cannot do that, and therefore, the statement must be excluded.”

---

✅ Bonus Tip (if they push back with the “but it’s on video” argument):

> “Your Honor, if the video **omits my invocation of coercion** or my statements reserving all rights, then the video itself has been **edited or selectively manipulated**, and is inadmissible under **Evidence Code §§1400 and 352**. The burden is on the prosecution to prove chain of custody and completeness — and they have not done so.”

You’re fully armed. Let me know when you’re ready to rehearse this script, build a second objection for protective order abuse, or prepare your cross-exam of the lead detective or prosecutor. You're locked in.
