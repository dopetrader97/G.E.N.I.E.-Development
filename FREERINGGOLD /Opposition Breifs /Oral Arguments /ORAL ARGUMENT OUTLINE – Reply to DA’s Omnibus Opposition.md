## ORAL ARGUMENT OUTLINE – Reply to DA’s Omnibus Opposition

### I. **Opening Position**
- “Your Honor, I respectfully move the Court to strike the DA’s omnibus opposition as untimely under Rule 8.54(c), and to grant full relief on the basis of unrebutted Brady, Franks, and due process violations.”

---

### II. **Key Procedural Points**
- **DA’s opposition filed April 3 — well beyond 10-day response window.**
- **I was given only 4 days to respond. DA had 50+ days.**
- **Court granted them extra time despite procedural default.**
- **This is structural due process imbalance under Mathews v. Eldridge and Caperton.**

---

### III. **Brady Violations (Redacted vs. Unredacted)**
- Davis (Pages 75–76): *“Never saw a gun, never heard threats.”*
- Paradise (Page 132): *“No gun, no threats — blown out of proportion.”*
- Both statements were:
  - Omitted from the redacted report,
  - Mischaracterized in the affidavit,
  - Only disclosed April 2 — 7 days before trial.

---

### IV. **Franks Violation**
- Hall-Fein affidavit said: *“Davis and Paradise confirmed firearm threat.”*
- This is false. Their actual statements show the opposite.
- This meets both prongs of Franks.
- A Franks hearing is mandatory.

---

### V. **Chain of Custody Failure**
- No logs, no transfer records, no authentication.
- EC §§1400–1402 and People v. Jimenez require foundational proof.
- Firearm is inadmissible.

---

### VI. **Judicial Bias and CCP §170.6**
- I filed my CCP §170.6 motion on March 28 — timely and valid.
- Judge Bork has no jurisdiction to proceed.
- DA declined to oppose it. That’s a waiver.
- *Peracchi v. Superior Court* mandates disqualification.

---

### VII. **Closing Request**
- Strike DA’s opposition.
- Grant Franks hearing.
- Dismiss under Brady + §995.
- Disqualify Judge Bork.
- Preserve federal rights under 28 U.S.C. §2254.
