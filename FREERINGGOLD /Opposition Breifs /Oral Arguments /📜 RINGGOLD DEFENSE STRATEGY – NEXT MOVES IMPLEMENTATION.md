Perfect — let’s begin with your **Demurrer + 995 Oral Argument Block**. These two motions go to the **heart of jurisdiction, charging defects, and prosecutorial overreach.**

---

## 🎙 ORAL ARGUMENT: DEMURRER + 995 MOTION  
**(Approx. 90 seconds – can be condensed to 60 if needed)**  
**Objective:** Establish that the prosecution has no valid charging instrument or legal basis to proceed.

---

### I. OPENING LINE

> *“Your Honor, the People have failed to file a valid accusatory pleading. There is no verified complaint under Penal Code §806, and the Information filed under §949 fails to cure that defect. The result is a jurisdictional failure — not a technical one.”*

---

### II. KEY POINTS TO HIT

#### 🔹 Demurrer (Penal Code §§ 950–952, 806, 949)
- “The Complaint was filed without verification or supporting declaration.”
- “The Information repeats the same defects — no factual specificity, no element-based structure.”
- “This violates People v. Jordan (1971), which requires the pleading to state *every essential fact*.”

#### 🔹 995 Motion
- “Even if the Court accepts the flawed pleading, the preliminary hearing transcript is void — based on false testimony and the omission of exculpatory witnesses.”
- “Magistrate relied on Patoria Hardy’s claims, which are now contradicted by Emmanuel Davis’s sworn affidavit and video evidence.”

---

### III. CASE LAW DROPS

- 📚 *People v. Tannahill* – an unverified complaint is a fatal defect.
- 📚 *People v. Superior Court (Barkdull)* – demurrer must be sustained when no offense is stated.
- 📚 *People v. Hall* – 995 requires dismissal where probable cause is lacking due to tainted or insufficient evidence.

---

### IV. ANTICIPATED OBJECTION: “Form over substance”
**Response:**  
> “This is not about form, Your Honor — it's about jurisdiction. Without verification, there is no proper initiation of criminal proceedings.”

---

### V. RELIEF REQUEST

> “We ask that the Court sustain the demurrer in full, grant the 995 motion, and dismiss the information for failure to state a public offense and for relying on facially unreliable evidence.”

## ✅ 3. POST-HEARING WRAP BRIEF (To Be Filed April 9)
**Title:** Motion to Preserve Federal Claims + Structural Objection Memo
**Purpose:**
- Preserve objections under: U.S. Const. Amend. V, VI, XIV, and Cal. Const. Art. I §§7, 15
- Invoke *exhaustion of remedies* for federal habeas corpus (28 U.S.C. §2254)
- Frame trial posture as proceeding under *judicial bias*, *unruled Brady violations*, and *unavailable witnesses*

**Key Language Preview:**
> "The Defendant respectfully preserves all objections on the basis of structural due process deprivation, unresolved evidentiary rulings, and active suppression of favorable material witnesses. Should trial proceed without remedy, Defendant reserves the right to seek immediate appellate relief or collateral post-conviction review."
