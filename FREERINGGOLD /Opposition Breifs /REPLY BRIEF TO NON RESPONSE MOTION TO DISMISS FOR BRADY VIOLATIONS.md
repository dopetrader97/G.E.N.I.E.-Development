## DEFENDANT’S REPLY TO THE PEOPLE’S FAILURE TO OPPOSE 5TH MOTION TO DISMISS FOR BRADY VIOLATIONS;  
### SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FROM UNREDACTED POLICE REPORT, SWORN AFFIDAVITS, AND RELATED FILINGS;  
### REQUEST FOR FORMAL FINDINGS AND FULL DISMISSAL UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

### I. INTRODUCTION

Defendant respectfully submits this reply in support of the **5th Motion to Dismiss – Brady Violation**, grounded in the **intentional suppression of exculpatory evidence** and the ongoing misconduct of both the prosecution and investigating officers.

As of April 3, 2025, the **District Attorney has filed no opposition** to this motion or to the following related filings:

- The **Motion to Suppress (Franks / PC §1538.5)**;
- The **Motion to Dismiss Under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine**;
- The **Motion for Judicial Inquiry**;
- The **Motion for Sanctions**.

The prosecution’s **complete silence** constitutes a **waiver of opposition** under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)** and further evidences an inability to refute the facts or law supporting dismissal.

---

### II. RULE 8.54(c) – FAILURE TO OPPOSE = WAIVER

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> “If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”

The prosecution has failed to oppose **any aspect** of this motion filed on **February 12, 2025**, despite overwhelming evidence of constitutional and procedural violations. Under Rule 8.54(c), this Court has full authority to grant the relief requested and issue written findings based on the unrebutted record.

---

### III. BRADY VIOLATIONS CONFIRMED IN THE UNREDACTED POLICE REPORT

The unredacted LAPD police report — delivered nearly two months late and only seven days before trial — confirms that:

- **Exculpatory witness statements** by **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise** were intentionally **redacted** and **withheld** from the initial discovery provided to the defense;
- These statements clearly **contradict the prosecution’s narrative** of firearm threats and criminal intent;
- **Emmanuel Davis’s sworn affidavit (Exhibit A)** explicitly affirms that no gun was seen or used, and no threats were made;
- Paradise, who came forward on **April 1, 2025**, has confirmed that she **never saw a weapon**, heard no threats, and is prepared to testify under oath.

The redactions were not clerical or benign — they were **deliberate omissions** of evidence favorable to the defense, in violation of:

- **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)**;
- **Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)**;
- **Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995)**;
- **California Penal Code §1054.1**.

---

### IV. WITNESS TAMPERING & POLICE MISCONDUCT DEMAND DISMISSAL

The unopposed record also shows that:

- LAPD Detectives **Hall-Fein**, **Gomez**, and others submitted a **warrant affidavit** falsely claiming that Davis and Paradise corroborated the presence of a firearm — a direct contradiction of the now-disclosed evidence;
- The **false affidavit** secured the **December 4 search**, making the firearm and all derivative evidence **inadmissible** under **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)**;
- The December 4 firearm recovery has **no chain of custody** and is **unrelated** to the November 13 allegations — its introduction would **prejudice the jury** without probative value.

> See:  
> **Franks v. Delaware (1978)** – Suppression of evidence obtained by deceitful warrant;  
> **Wong Sun v. United States (1963)** – Exclusion of derivative evidence;  
> **People v. Jimenez, 22 Cal.3d 595 (1978)** – Chain-of-custody defects render evidence inadmissible.

---

### V. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT: A CLEAR PATTERN

As detailed in the related **Motion for Sanctions** and **Motion for Judicial Inquiry**, the prosecution:

- **Knowingly delayed disclosure** of the unredacted report for over 50 days;
- **Filed a protective order** to conceal discovery of Brady materials;
- **Violated a March 28, 2025 court order** by failing to meet and confer;
- **Refused to correct false claims** in their charging documents or investigative affidavits;
- Continues to **rely on tainted, inadmissible evidence** to prosecute charges that lack any factual or legal foundation.

This conduct justifies **dismissal under United States v. Chapman, 524 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2008)**, which held that suppression of material Brady evidence constitutes misconduct so severe that dismissal is the only appropriate remedy.

---

### VI. RELIEF REQUESTED – FINDINGS AND DISMISSAL

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant the 5th Motion to Dismiss in full** based on unrebutted Brady, Franks, and due process violations;
2. Issue formal written findings that:
   - The prosecution failed to oppose under Rule 8.54(c);
   - Brady evidence was deliberately withheld;
   - The affidavit used to obtain the search warrant was materially false;
   - The chain of custody is broken;
   - Prosecutorial and police misconduct has tainted the entire proceeding;
3. **Dismiss all charges with prejudice**;
4. **Preserve the appellate record** with detailed findings of fact and law.

---

### VII. CONCLUSION

The prosecution has offered **no factual rebuttal**, no legal defense, and no justification for its ongoing misconduct. The failure to respond is a **silent concession**. The facts stand unrebutted. The law is clear. The evidence is tainted.

This Court must now:

- **Dismiss the charges in full**,  
- **Grant all related motions incorporated herein by reference**, and  
- **Issue written findings to ensure constitutional and appellate protection**.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
