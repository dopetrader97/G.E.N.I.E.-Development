Perfect. Below is **Version C** of your **Opposition Brief** ‚Äî written in your exact tone, format, and voice ‚Äî in response to a **substantive DA opposition**. This version assumes the DA has attempted to substantively argue against your Brady, Franks, and chain-of-custody claims but has either (1) misrepresented the record, (2) failed to rebut key constitutional violations, or (3) attempted to excuse misconduct through procedural justifications.

# üßæ **OPPOSITION BRIEF ‚Äì VERSION C**  
### *Response to Substantive District Attorney Opposition*

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**[Your Full Name]**,  
Defendant.  

Case No.: [Case Number]  
Dept.: [Department]  
Judge: [Judge's Name]  

**DEFENDANT‚ÄôS REPLY TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS SUBSTANTIVE OPPOSITION TO PENDING MOTIONS; REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS**

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

Defendant respectfully submits this reply in response to the District Attorney‚Äôs substantive opposition to Defendant‚Äôs pending motions. The DA‚Äôs response, while styled as a substantive filing, fails to overcome or refute the **constitutional violations, factual misrepresentations, and evidentiary flaws** established by the **unredacted police report**, the **sworn affidavit of Emmanuel Davis**, and the **anticipated exculpatory testimony of Melissa Paradise**.

The prosecution‚Äôs opposition misstates material facts, offers no legal basis to excuse its misconduct, and fails to rebut the clear violations of **Brady v. Maryland**, **Franks v. Delaware**, and the **California Evidence Code**. The DA's opposition cannot cure these violations retroactively.

---

### II. **REBUTTAL TO DA‚ÄôS ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN BRADY VIOLATION**

The prosecution attempts to excuse the late disclosure and redaction of exculpatory witness statements by claiming that:

- The omission was inadvertent or immaterial;
- The statements were disclosed prior to trial and therefore did not prejudice the defense.

**This argument fails both factually and legally.**

#### A. **Sworn Affidavit from Emmanuel Davis (Exhibit A):**
- Explicitly confirms Davis told police there was **no gun**, **no threat**, and **no aggressive behavior** by Defendant on November 13.
- This was entirely omitted from the redacted police report, contradicting the DA‚Äôs claim that the omission was harmless.

#### B. **Unredacted Police Report Confirms Redaction Was Selective and Intentional:**
- Melissa Paradise's exculpatory statements were also deliberately removed.
- This violates the prosecution‚Äôs duty under **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)** and **California Penal Code ¬ß1054.1(e)**.

#### C. **Late Disclosure Prejudiced Trial Preparation:**
- Discovery was delayed for over **50 days** and provided only **7 days before trial**.
- No time to investigate, secure witness declarations, or prepare defense strategy based on that evidence.

**The prosecution's response does not rebut any of these facts ‚Äî it merely attempts to reframe them. Brady is not about timing alone ‚Äî it‚Äôs about fairness.**

---

### III. **FRANKS VIOLATION: DA FAILS TO ADDRESS MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS IN WARRANT AFFIDAVIT**

The DA's opposition ignores the most damning fact: the warrant affidavit **falsely claimed** that Davis and Paradise corroborated the presence of a firearm.

- The **unredacted report and Davis‚Äôs affidavit** prove that both witnesses **explicitly denied** seeing a weapon or hearing threats.
- **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)** requires suppression where a warrant is obtained using **false or recklessly omitted facts**.

The prosecution provides **no justification**, no retraction, and no evidence that these claims were true ‚Äî because they weren't. This is not a matter of interpretation; this is an **intentional misstatement of fact in a sworn warrant affidavit**. The warrant is invalid. Everything seized under it must be suppressed.

---

### IV. **CHAIN OF CUSTODY REMAINS DEFICIENT AND UNREBUTTED**

The DA fails to provide a complete or coherent chain of custody for the firearm allegedly recovered on December 4:

- No timestamped records,
- No documentation of who handled it,
- No forensic linkage to the November 13 incident.

The firearm is **not relevant to the charged conduct**, is **highly prejudicial**, and lacks any admissibility under **Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402**.

The DA attempts to argue the weapon is ‚Äúcircumstantially relevant‚Äù ‚Äî but this ignores the fact that it was recovered weeks later from a location unrelated to the alleged offense. The DA‚Äôs own filings fail to establish even **basic authentication**. That alone warrants exclusion.

---

### V. **PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IS CLEAR AND UNREBUTTED**

The DA‚Äôs opposition does **not dispute**:

- The failure to comply with the **March 28 court-ordered meet-and-confer deadline**;
- The 50-day delay in providing the unredacted police report;
- The improper **motion for protective order** that appears aimed at concealing misconduct, not protecting witnesses;
- The **conflation of unrelated events (Dec. 4 firearm) with the Nov. 13 charges** to inflame prejudice.

These are not procedural missteps. These are **intentional acts that violated the Defendant‚Äôs rights** under the **Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments**. The opposition fails to explain ‚Äî let alone justify ‚Äî any of them.

---

### VI. **REQUEST FOR WRITTEN JUDICIAL FINDINGS**

To preserve the record for appellate and federal review, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court issue **explicit written findings** on:

- The existence and impact of Brady violations;
- Whether the search warrant affidavit violated Franks;
- The insufficiency of chain of custody under Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402;
- The procedural and constitutional prejudice caused by prosecutorial delay, redaction, and conflation of separate events.

---

### VII. **CONCLUSION**

The District Attorney‚Äôs opposition fails to rebut the fundamental defects in this case. The unredacted report, the sworn testimony, and the record itself all point to a prosecution shaped not by the facts, but by omissions, distortions, and unlawful tactics.

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant the Motion to Dismiss** pursuant to **Penal Code ¬ß995**;
2. **Suppress all evidence seized pursuant to the invalid warrant** under **Franks v. Delaware**;
3. **Exclude the December 4 firearm** as irrelevant, inadmissible, and prejudicial;
4. **Deny the People‚Äôs Motion for Protective Order**;
5. **Sanction the prosecution** for Brady violations and discovery misconduct;
6. **Issue written findings on all constitutional and evidentiary issues raised**.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**[Your Name]**  
Defendant In Pro Per (or counsel of record)

‚úÖ Let me know and I‚Äôll immediately prepare the **oral argument outline for this Version C scenario** ‚Äî anticipating and dismantling the DA‚Äôs best attempts at a substantive defense.

We‚Äôll focus it around courtroom-ready phrasing, constitutional hooks, and direct appeals to judicial accountability. Ready to proceed?
