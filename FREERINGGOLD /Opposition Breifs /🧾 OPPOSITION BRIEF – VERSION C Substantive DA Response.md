Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs knock this out clean and tight.

First, I‚Äôll revise **Version C** of your **Opposition Brief** to include the **coerced statement suppression argument** as a full new section, seamlessly integrated. Then, I‚Äôll give you a **real-time courtroom objection script** so you‚Äôre fully armed if the DA tries to use any paraphrased ‚Äúadmissions‚Äù in court.

# üßæ **REVISED OPPOSITION BRIEF ‚Äì VERSION C**  
### *Now Including Coerced Statement Suppression Argument*

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**[Your Full Name]**,  
Defendant.  

Case No.: [Case Number]  
Dept.: [Department]  
Judge: [Judge's Name]  

**DEFENDANT‚ÄôS REPLY TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS SUBSTANTIVE OPPOSITION TO PENDING MOTIONS; REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS**

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

The District Attorney‚Äôs opposition fails to overcome the constitutional and evidentiary violations at the core of this prosecution:  
- **Suppressed exculpatory witness statements** (Brady violations);  
- **False and misleading affidavit language** used to obtain a warrant (Franks violation);  
- **Unreliable chain of custody for physical evidence**; and  
- A **coerced, improperly obtained statement** from the Defendant, now improperly framed as a voluntary admission.

The People‚Äôs response relies on post hoc rationalizations and omits any documentation demonstrating that proper procedures were followed during interrogation or evidence handling. This Court must not condone misconduct by omission.

---

### II. **COERCED STATEMENT MUST BE SUPPRESSED ‚Äì FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION**

The prosecution has referenced statements allegedly made by Defendant during a video-recorded interview. These statements are paraphrased in multiple portions of the police report (e.g., pages 18‚Äì22, 101‚Äì104 of Discovery Part 1), yet the following is **undisputed**:

- **No Miranda advisement is documented** in any police report;
- **No waiver of rights was signed or referenced**;
- **No transcript** of the recorded statement has been produced;
- **No chain of custody documentation** has been provided for the video; and
- Defendant **repeatedly stated on video** that all responses were given **under threat, duress, and coercion**, and explicitly **reserved all rights**.

If the District Attorney attempts to use that video or its paraphrased contents as a voluntary admission, the statement must be suppressed. Under:

- **Fifth Amendment** (right against self-incrimination),
- **Fourteenth Amendment** (due process),
- **Miranda v. Arizona**, 384 U.S. 436 (1966),
- **Jackson v. Denno**, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), and
- **People v. Neal**, 31 Cal.4th 63 (2003),

...a confession is **inadmissible unless proven to be voluntary**, and the prosecution has not ‚Äî and cannot ‚Äî meet that burden here.

If the recording omits Defendant‚Äôs invocation of coercion, then the evidence has been **altered or selectively edited**, further supporting suppression under **California Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402** and **¬ß352**.

---

### III. **(Rest of Brief Continues ‚Äì Brady, Franks, Chain of Custody, Prosecutorial Misconduct)**  
*No changes needed to these sections. The rest of Version C remains fully intact.*

---

### IV. **CONCLUSION (Updated)**

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant the Motion to Dismiss** pursuant to **Penal Code ¬ß995**;  
2. **Suppress all evidence obtained via the invalid warrant** under **Franks v. Delaware**;  
3. **Exclude the December 4 firearm** under **Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402** and **¬ß352**;  
4. **Suppress the coerced video statement**, or any derivative evidence, as obtained in violation of **Miranda**, the **Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments**, and **Jackson v. Denno**;  
5. **Deny the People‚Äôs Motion for Protective Order**;  
6. **Issue written findings** on each of the constitutional and evidentiary grounds raised.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**[Your Name]**  
Defendant In Pro Per (or counsel of record)
