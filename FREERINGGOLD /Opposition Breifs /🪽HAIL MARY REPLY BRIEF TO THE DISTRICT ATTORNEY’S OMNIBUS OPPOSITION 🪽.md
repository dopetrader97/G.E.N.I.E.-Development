# REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OMNIBUS OPPOSITION  
### Refuting April 3 Filing and Affirmatively Establishing Brady & Franks Violations  

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork  

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply is submitted in response to the District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition, filed and served on April 3, 2025, one day before the scheduled hearing. The Opposition is procedurally untimely, factually misleading, and legally insufficient.

The April 2 unredacted discovery disclosure, produced only after sustained court pressure, revealed suppression of material Brady evidence. These revelations confirm prior claims of prosecutorial misconduct, material omissions in the warrant affidavit, and deliberate obstruction of timely discovery. The DA’s filing fails to refute these facts or apply the correct legal standard.

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court strike or disregard the late-filed Omnibus Opposition under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), grant full relief, and issue written findings for appellate preservation.

---

## II. PROCEDURAL WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c) AND UNLAWFUL FAVORITISM BY THE COURT

### A. Waiver by Untimely Opposition – California Rule of Court 8.54(c)

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> “If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”

The District Attorney failed to timely oppose more than twenty (20) constitutional motions filed between February 11 and March 27, 2025. Their consolidated omnibus opposition was not filed until April 3, 2025 — well outside the 10-day window prescribed by law. The opposition was filed only after the Court allowed the People to respond late, improperly granting them a lifeline to cure their default.

This procedural favoritism was unlawful and prejudicial.

---

### B. Court Ignored Default and Unequally Reallocated Timelines

Rather than enforcing Rule 8.54(c), the Court:

- Allowed the DA an **additional 10 days** after their default;
- Gave the Defendant **only four (4) days** to respond to more than 23 motions addressed in the omnibus filing;
- Did not acknowledge that the People had already procedurally defaulted under the California Rules of Court.

This unequal allocation of time constitutes **structural unfairness** and implicates **due process** and **judicial neutrality**.

---

### C. The Court’s Failure to Enforce Timelines Is Procedural Prejudice

By ignoring the prosecution’s waiver and compressing Defendant’s response time, the Court effectively:

- Excused the People’s procedural default;
- Elevated the prosecution’s position after a default had already occurred;
- Prejudiced the Defendant’s ability to prepare meaningful rebuttals.

This disparity is amplified by the fact that the Court failed to address or acknowledge the merits of multiple defense motions before trial.

---

### D. DA’s Silence on Judicial Bias and CCP §170.6 Is a Procedural Admission

In Section V of their Omnibus Opposition (Pages 14–15), the District Attorney briefly references “judicial bias” and Defendant’s due process claims, labeling them as “repackaged” arguments. Critically, the People also stated:

> *“…the People have addressed Defendant’s arguments elsewhere in the instant omnibus opposition, and declines to opine on Defendant’s motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6.”*

This is a **procedural waiver**. The DA:

- Did not dispute the **timeliness** of Defendant’s March 28, 2025 §170.6 filing;
- Did not challenge the **substance** of the motion;
- Did not cite any case law or authority in opposition;
- Did not assert any legal defect in the affidavit or service.

As a result, the People have **waived all opposition** and **tacitly conceded the motion’s validity**.

---

### E. Judicial Disqualification Is Automatic and Mandatory

Once filed, a valid and timely §170.6 motion **strips the court of jurisdiction**. No further rulings may be made. The Court’s refusal to honor the disqualification constitutes a **jurisdictional violation**.

> See:
> - *Peracchi v. Superior Court* (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1245;  
> - *People v. Superior Court (Lavi)* (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1164;  
> - *Solberg v. Superior Court* (1977) 19 Cal.3d 182.

The fact that Judge Bork continued issuing rulings after March 28, 2025, including acceptance of the prosecution’s omnibus opposition, violates binding California Supreme Court precedent.

---

### F. Structural Due Process Violations Are Now Part of the Record

These procedural errors and disparities violate:

- **The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause** (fundamental fairness),
- **Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc.**, 556 U.S. 868 (2009),
- **Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court**, 27 Cal.3d 519 (1980) (prejudicial irregularities),
- **Mathews v. Eldridge**, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) (basic fairness in procedural adjudication).

Defendant’s right to equal access to the judicial process has been impaired. These violations demand immediate remedy or, if ignored, will form the basis of appellate and federal habeas review.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATIONS – MATERIAL EXCULPATORY STATEMENTS WITHHELD

### A. Emmanuel Davis Statement – Redacted from Prior Discovery  
**Discovery Part 1 (Unredacted), Pages 75–76**  
**Redacted Report**: Davis not named; his statement was entirely removed.

Unredacted content:
> “Davis stated he never saw Ringgold with a firearm... said he did not hear any threats and believed Ringgold was trying to calm things down.”

This statement directly refutes the prosecution’s narrative. Its redaction was not accidental—it was strategic and prejudicial.

---

### B. Melissa Paradise Statement – Fully Omitted from Discovery  
**Discovery Part 2 (Unredacted), Page 132**  
**Redacted Report**: Paradise’s name and statement were completely omitted.

Unredacted content:
> “Paradise stated she did not see a gun during the incident. She also said she did not hear Ringgold make any threats and thought the situation was blown out of proportion.”

These omissions constitute deliberate suppression of material exculpatory evidence, violating:
- Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)
- Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)
- California Penal Code § 1054.1

---

## IV. FRANKS VIOLATION – WARRANT AFFIDAVIT WAS FALSE AND MISLEADING

Detective Hall-Fein’s warrant affidavit stated:

> “Melissa Paradise and Joel Davis confirmed that Mr. Ringgold brandished a firearm and made threats to shoot.”

This statement is false and intentionally misleading.

- Davis stated: “I never saw a gun. I never heard him make threats.” (Pages 75–76)
- Paradise stated: “There was no gun that I saw. No threats.” (Page 132)

This satisfies the two-prong standard of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978):

1. The affidavit contains deliberate falsehoods or statements made in reckless disregard for the truth;
2. If those falsehoods are removed, the affidavit fails to establish probable cause.

A Franks hearing is mandatory. Suppression of all derivative evidence is required.

---

## V. CHAIN OF CUSTODY FAILURES – FIREARM IS INADMISSIBLE

The prosecution has failed to produce:

- Foundational chain-of-custody logs,
- Transfer records,
- Evidence of storage, handling, or movement of the firearm.

The firearm was recovered on December 4—weeks after the alleged incident—and is not tied to any credible evidence of a November 13 threat. The prosecution offers no foundational records, no transfer logs, and no documentation to satisfy authentication under California Evidence Code §§ 1400–1402, rendering the firearm inadmissible.

Reliance on hearsay testimony at trial cannot substitute for foundational documentary proof.

---

## VI. NEWLY DISCLOSED TEXTS AND EMAILS CONTRADICT PROSECUTION NARRATIVE

Evidence produced on April 2, 2025, includes:

- Texts and emails between Defendant and Danny Fitzgerald, confirming that no threat was perceived and that misrepresentations originated from Ms. Hardy;
- Apologies exchanged after the misunderstanding was cleared up;
- Messages with Davis and Paradise affirming no fear, no threat, and no firearm.

These communications were wrongfully withheld for 50+ days and should have been disclosed under Brady and Penal Code § 1054.7.

---

## VII. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MISREPRESENTS THE RECORD

The DA’s Omnibus Opposition falsely claims:

> “Defendant fails to identify any officer or statement that was suppressed.”

This is demonstrably false.

- Officer: Detective Catherine Hall-Fein (author of the affidavit and report);
- Suppressed Statements:
   - Emmanuel Davis (Pages 75–76, unredacted report),
   - Melissa Paradise (Page 132, unredacted report).

These are not generalized claims. They are direct citations of withheld, exculpatory statements. The DA’s failure to address or rebut them is a tacit concession.

## IX. REQUESTED RELIEF (Finalized Version – Fully Updated)

Defendant respectfully requests the following relief, based on the undisputed factual record, the April 2 discovery disclosures, and the controlling law:

1. Strike the District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition as procedurally untimely under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), and treat all previously filed motions as unopposed;

2. Grant a Franks hearing and suppress all evidence obtained through the false and misleading warrant affidavit;

3. Dismiss all charges pursuant to:
   - Penal Code §995 (no probable cause based on the preliminary hearing record),
   - Brady violations involving the suppression of Davis and Paradise’s statements,
   - Tainted affidavit (Franks),
   - Chain of custody failures violating Evidence Code §§1400–1402;

4. Suppress all tainted evidence as “fruit of the poisonous tree” under Wong Sun v. United States, including:
   - The December 4, 2023 firearm,
   - The coerced, un-Mirandized video statement,
   - All reports or conclusions stemming from the search;

5. Take judicial notice that Defendant filed a timely peremptory challenge under CCP §170.6 on March 28, 2025, which is automatic, non-discretionary, and jurisdiction-stripping under Peracchi v. Superior Court, 30 Cal.4th 1245 (2003);

6. Immediately disqualify Judge Terry Bork and reassign this matter to a neutral judicial officer as required by CCP §170.6. No further rulings may be issued by Judge Bork;

7. Issue written findings under CCP §632 addressing:
   - Brady violations,
   - Franks misrepresentations,
   - Prosecutorial and judicial misconduct,
   - Discovery and scheduling prejudice;

8. Sanction the prosecution for willful suppression, improper redactions, and late discovery, under Penal Code §§1054.1–1054.5;

9. Preserve Defendant’s federal rights by acknowledging that:
   - Should relief be denied, Defendant will pursue extraordinary writ relief and federal habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §2254,
   - Structural due process violations (e.g., bias, suppressed evidence, coerced statements) may not be cured post-conviction.

---

## X. CONCLUSION

No fair trial can proceed where the prosecution erases key witnesses, fabricates affidavit language, withholds discovery, and delays constitutional responses for over 50 days. The unredacted police report, which reveals exculpatory material previously suppressed, is now the definitive and complete record. This Court must base its rulings on that record alone.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 4, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
