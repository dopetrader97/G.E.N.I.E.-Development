# üßæ REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS OMNIBUS OPPOSITION  
### *Refuting April 2 Filing and Affirmatively Establishing Brady & Franks Violations*  

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply is submitted in response to the **District Attorney‚Äôs Omnibus Opposition**, filed at **3:59 PM on April 3, 2025**, just minutes before the filing deadline. The opposition is **procedurally defective**, **factually misleading**, and **legally insufficient**, and fails to address the core **Brady**, **Franks**, and **due process violations**.

The newly disclosed **unredacted police reports**, released only **7 days before trial**, definitively confirm that exculpatory witness statements were:

- **Intentionally redacted**;
- **Mischaracterized in Detective Hall-Fein‚Äôs affidavit**;
- **Withheld for 50+ days**, prejudicing trial preparation.

The prosecution‚Äôs April 2 opposition is a last-ditch effort to obscure the record. It fails to rebut the factual content of the affidavit, the police reports, or the exculpatory statements now entered into the record.

---

## II. RULE 8.54(c) VIOLATION ‚Äì OPPOSITION FILED UNTIMELY

Under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

The prosecution filed a consolidated omnibus opposition on April 2 ‚Äî well beyond the 10-day statutory window for multiple motions filed on February 14. Procedurally, the opposition should be treated as a **waiver** under 8.54(c), and the relief sought in Defendant‚Äôs motions **should be granted by default**.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATIONS ‚Äì MATERIAL EXCULPATORY STATEMENTS WITHHELD

### A. Emmanuel Davis Statement ‚Äì Omitted and Redacted

**Discovery Part 1 (Unredacted), Pages 75‚Äì76**  
üóÇ**Redacted Police Report**: Entirely excludes Davis‚Äôs name, role, and statement.

**Unredacted content:**
> *‚ÄúDavis stated he never saw Ringgold with a firearm... said he did not hear any threats and believed Ringgold was trying to calm things down.‚Äù*

This is **direct exculpatory evidence**, affirmatively denying any criminal conduct.  
**Omitted entirely** from the redacted version.

---

### B. Melissa Paradise Statement ‚Äì Omitted and Redacted

**Discovery Part 2 (Unredacted), Page 132**  
üóÇ**Redacted Police Report**: Omitted completely ‚Äî name and content absent.

**Unredacted content:**
> *‚ÄúParadise stated she did not see a gun during the incident. She also said she did not hear Ringgold make any threats and thought the situation was blown out of proportion.‚Äù*

This directly contradicts the prosecution‚Äôs case and the affidavit.  
Entirely omitted ‚Äî **name not even mentioned** in redacted discovery.

---

### C. Legal Framework ‚Äì Why This Is a Brady Violation

Under **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)** and **California Penal Code ¬ß1054.1**, the prosecution has a **constitutional and statutory duty** to disclose:

- Evidence that **negates guilt**;
- Witness statements that **undermine probable cause**;
- Testimony that is **material to the defense**.

The **50-day delay** and total redaction of these exculpatory witness statements was **not inadvertent** ‚Äî it was strategic, prejudicial, and **unconstitutional**.

---

## IV. FRANKS VIOLATION ‚Äì WARRANT AFFIDAVIT KNOWINGLY FALSE

Detective Hall-Fein‚Äôs affidavit claimed:

> *‚ÄúMelissa Paradise and Joel Davis confirmed that Mr. Ringgold brandished a firearm and made threats to shoot.‚Äù*

This is demonstrably **false**:

- Davis: *‚ÄúI never saw a gun. Never heard him make threats.‚Äù* (Pg. 75‚Äì76)
- Paradise: *‚ÄúThere was no gun that I saw. No threats.‚Äù* (Pg. 132)

These are **not omissions** ‚Äî they are **fabrications** when misrepresented as corroborations.

Under **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)**, suppression is required where:

1. The affidavit contains **deliberate falsehoods or reckless disregard** for the truth;
2. **Removing those falsehoods** destroys probable cause.

That standard is met here. A **Franks hearing** must be granted, and all derivative evidence must be suppressed.

---

## V. CHAIN OF CUSTODY FAILURES REMAIN UNRESOLVED

Despite court orders and formal requests, the prosecution:

- Has not produced firearm transfer logs;
- Has not authenticated the evidence under **Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402**;
- Has not rebutted the Defendant‚Äôs motion showing a complete lack of foundation.

The firearm seized on December 4, 2023, is not tied to the alleged November 13 incident and was **prejudicially introduced** through tainted affidavit evidence.

---

## VI. TEXTS, EMAILS & SURVEILLANCE EXPOSE FALSE NARRATIVE

Recently disclosed communications (April 2, 2025) show:

- **Danny Fitzgerald** never perceived a threat;
- The alleged threats originated from a **false narrative told by Ms. Hardy**, not from Defendant;
- After the misunderstanding was cleared up, **apologies were exchanged** ‚Äî not charges.

This undermines the factual basis for **Count 6 (Pen. Code ¬ß422)** and supports dismissal under **Pen. Code ¬ß995** for lack of probable cause.

---

## VII. DA‚ÄôS OPPOSITION FALSELY CLAIMS ‚ÄúNO SUPPRESSED STATEMENTS IDENTIFIED‚Äù

The DA states:

> *‚ÄúDefendant fails to identify any officer or statement that was suppressed.‚Äù*

This is patently false:

- **Officer**: Detective Hall-Fein, who authored the affidavit;
- **Statements**:  
  - Emmanuel Davis ‚Äì Pages 75‚Äì76 (Exculpatory; redacted);  
  - Melissa Paradise ‚Äì Page 132 (Exculpatory; omitted).

The redacted report **intentionally removed** these statements. The DA‚Äôs opposition ignores these facts and provides **no rebuttal**.

## IX. REQUESTED RELIEF

1. **Disregard or strike Omnibus Opposition** under Rule 8.54(c);
2. **Grant a Franks hearing** and suppress all evidence obtained through the tainted warrant;
3. **Dismiss all charges** for:
   - Lack of probable cause under PC ¬ß995;
   - Due process violations;
   - Chain-of-custody failures;
4. **Issue written findings** confirming:
   - Brady violations;
   - Franks misstatements;
   - Discovery misconduct;
   - Procedural prejudice;
5. **Sanction the prosecution** for violating court orders and ethical duties.

---

## X. CONCLUSION

The redacted police report presented a **fabricated case narrative**. The unredacted report ‚Äî disclosed only after a court-ordered meet-and-confer ‚Äî proves the DA built this case on **false affidavits and suppressed testimony**.

This is no longer a question of legal interpretation ‚Äî it is a matter of **fundamental fairness** and **constitutional integrity**.

Respectfully submitted,  
**Dated: April 4, 2025**  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
