## DEFENDANT‚ÄôS REPLY TO THE PEOPLE‚ÄôS FAILURE TO OPPOSE MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR BRADY VIOLATIONS;  
### REQUEST FOR FINDINGS AND REMEDIAL ORDERS;  
### SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FROM RECORD AND RELATED MOTIONS

### I. INTRODUCTION

Defendant respectfully submits this **reply in support of the Motion for Sanctions Against the Prosecution for Withholding Evidence**, which remains **unopposed** as of April 3, 2025.

This reply incorporates by reference the findings of fact and legal arguments presented in:

- The unopposed **Motion to Dismiss for Brady Violation**;
- The **Motion to Suppress Evidence** under **Franks v. Delaware / PC ¬ß1538.5**;
- The **Motion to Dismiss Under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine**;
- The **Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct**.

Together, these filings establish a **documented pattern of discovery misconduct**, investigative suppression, and willful concealment of exculpatory evidence ‚Äî none of which the prosecution has refuted.

---

### II. THE PROSECUTION HAS WAIVED OPPOSITION UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

California Rule of Court **8.54(c)** provides:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

The District Attorney has failed to respond to this motion within the statutory window. In the absence of opposition, this Court may ‚Äî and should ‚Äî grant the relief sought, including the imposition of sanctions or dismissal, consistent with **Chapman** and California case law.

---

### III. BRADY VIOLATIONS WARRANT SANCTIONS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW

The motion presented clear and unrefuted evidence that the prosecution:

- **Willfully withheld exculpatory witness statements** from both **Emmanuel Davis** (documented via sworn affidavit) and **Melissa Paradise** (whose redacted statements were recently disclosed in the unredacted police report);
- Suppressed these statements for **over 50 days**, producing them **only 7 days before trial**;
- Failed to comply with **California Penal Code ¬ß1054.1**, which mandates full and timely disclosure of all relevant and exculpatory evidence.

These actions violate:

- **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)** ‚Äì Due process violation for suppression of material evidence;
- **Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)** ‚Äì Failure to disclose evidence affecting witness credibility;
- **Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995)** ‚Äì State responsibility for evidence held by law enforcement;
- **United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976)** ‚Äì No request necessary to trigger Brady obligations;
- **United States v. Chapman, 524 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2008)** ‚Äì Dismissal is appropriate for egregious Brady violations;
- **CPC ¬ß1054.1** ‚Äì Failure to produce exculpatory discovery is a statutory violation.

---

### IV. DISCOVERY MISCONDUCT IS NOW A PATTERN, NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT

The prosecution‚Äôs silence must be viewed in light of repeated misconduct, including:

- **Redacting exculpatory witness identities** (Davis and Paradise) from the original police report;
- Filing a **protective order** designed to suppress public and judicial scrutiny of withheld Brady evidence;
- Violating the court-ordered **March 28, 2025 meet-and-confer deadline**, with no reasonable justification;
- Attempting to admit **a firearm recovered during a separate incident (December 4)**, despite no nexus to the November 13 charges ‚Äî while failing to provide chain-of-custody documentation.

Each of these points is supported by documentary evidence now filed in the record, and none have been rebutted or explained.

---

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR SANCTIONS OR DISMISSAL

Under both state and federal authority, this Court possesses inherent and statutory authority to impose sanctions including:

1. **Exclusion of tainted or undisclosed evidence**;
2. **Monetary or procedural sanctions against the prosecuting agency**;
3. **Dismissal of charges**, where the misconduct is severe and prejudicial ‚Äî as in **United States v. Chapman**, where similar violations warranted dismissal with prejudice.

This Court also has the authority to refer this matter for **further judicial inquiry** pursuant to the unopposed **Motion for Judicial Inquiry** filed February 12, 2025.

---

### VI. REQUEST FOR FINDINGS AND RELIEF

In light of the prosecution‚Äôs failure to oppose this motion or refute its factual allegations, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court issue written findings that:

1. The prosecution failed to timely oppose the motion and has waived objection under **Rule 8.54(c)**;
2. The redacted police report omitted exculpatory evidence from **Davis** and **Paradise**;
3. The suppression of evidence violated **Brady**, **Giglio**, and **CPC ¬ß1054.1**;
4. The delay in disclosure prejudiced Defendant‚Äôs ability to prepare a timely and adequate defense;
5. Sanctions are warranted, up to and including **dismissal of all charges**.

---

### VII. CONCLUSION

The **failure to oppose this motion**, coupled with the **unrefuted Brady violations**, deliberate discovery suppression, and bad-faith litigation tactics, compels this Court to take immediate remedial action. The integrity of the proceedings has been irreparably compromised.

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

- **Grant the Motion for Sanctions in full**;
- **Issue formal findings and relief**, including dismissal or other appropriate sanctions;
- **Compel immediate full discovery of all remaining exculpatory materials**;
- **Preserve the appellate record** with a complete statement of findings.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
