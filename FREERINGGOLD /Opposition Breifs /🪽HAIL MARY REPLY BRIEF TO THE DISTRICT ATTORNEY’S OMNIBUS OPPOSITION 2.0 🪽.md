# REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OMNIBUS OPPOSITION  
### Refuting April 3 Filing and Affirmatively Establishing Brady & Franks Violations  

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply is submitted in response to the District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition, filed and served on April 3, 2025, one day before the scheduled hearing. The opposition is procedurally untimely, factually misleading, and legally insufficient.

The recently disclosed unredacted police reports—provided on April 2, 2025—reveal multiple Brady violations, material misstatements in the warrant affidavit under Franks v. Delaware, and discovery misconduct. The prosecution’s April 3 opposition fails to address or refute these facts and instead relies on general denials unsupported by evidence or law.

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court strike or disregard the late-filed opposition under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), grant the constitutional relief requested, and issue formal written findings.

---

## II. PROCEDURAL WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> “If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”

The District Attorney failed to file timely oppositions to over twenty constitutional motions filed between February 14 and March 27, 2025. The consolidated opposition submitted on April 3, 2025—after the 10-day response window—constitutes a procedural waiver.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATIONS – MATERIAL EXCULPATORY STATEMENTS WITHHELD

### A. Emmanuel Davis Statement – Redacted from Prior Discovery  
**Discovery Part 1 (Unredacted), Pages 75–76**  
**Redacted Report**: Davis not named; his statement was entirely removed.

Unredacted content:
> “Davis stated he never saw Ringgold with a firearm... said he did not hear any threats and believed Ringgold was trying to calm things down.”

This statement was wholly redacted and withheld, violating Brady v. Maryland and California Penal Code § 1054.1.

---

### B. Melissa Paradise Statement – Fully Omitted from Discovery  
**Discovery Part 2 (Unredacted), Page 132**  
**Redacted Report**: Paradise’s name and statement omitted entirely.

Unredacted content:
> “Paradise stated she did not see a gun during the incident. She also said she did not hear Ringgold make any threats and thought the situation was blown out of proportion.”

This omission constitutes a deliberate suppression of exculpatory evidence, violating:
- Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)
- Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)
- California Penal Code § 1054.1

---

## IV. FRANKS VIOLATION – WARRANT AFFIDAVIT WAS FALSE AND MISLEADING

Detective Hall-Fein’s affidavit stated:

> “Melissa Paradise and Joel Davis confirmed that Mr. Ringgold brandished a firearm and made threats to shoot.”

This is demonstrably false.

- Davis stated: “I never saw a gun. I never heard him make threats.” (Pages 75–76)
- Paradise stated: “There was no gun that I saw. No threats.” (Page 132)

These exculpatory statements were omitted and misrepresented. This satisfies both prongs of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978):

1. The affidavit contained deliberate falsehoods or reckless disregard for the truth;  
2. Removing the falsehoods eliminates probable cause for the warrant.

A Franks hearing is now mandatory. All derivative evidence must be suppressed.

---

## V. CHAIN OF CUSTODY FAILURES – FIREARM IS INADMISSIBLE

The prosecution has not produced:

- Chain-of-custody logs;
- Transfer forms;
- Authentication of the December 4 firearm.

The firearm remains inadmissible under Evidence Code §§ 1400–1402 and People v. Jimenez, 22 Cal.3d 595 (1978). The DA’s statement that the evidence “can be authenticated at trial” ignores pretrial evidentiary standards and suppression procedure.

---

## VI. NEWLY DISCLOSED TEXTS AND EMAILS CONTRADICT THE DA’S THEORY

Discovery provided on April 2, 2025, includes:

- Texts and emails between Defendant and landlord Danny Fitzgerald confirming that no threat was perceived;
- Apologies exchanged after clarifying the misunderstanding;
- Communications with Davis and Paradise confirming no fear or threat.

This new evidence undermines Count 6 and reveals a narrative fabricated through omission and delay. These messages were suppressed for over 50 days, further violating Brady and Penal Code § 1054.7.

---

## VII. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MISREPRESENTS THE RECORD

The DA asserts:

> “Defendant fails to identify any officer or statement that was suppressed.”

That is false.

- Officer: Detective Hall-Fein
- Suppressed Statements:
  - Emmanuel Davis (Pages 75–76)
  - Melissa Paradise (Page 132)

These facts are in the unredacted discovery, directly contradicting the affidavit. The prosecution’s failure to rebut them amounts to a concession.

## IX. REQUESTED RELIEF (Final Version – Legally Sound & Procedurally Accurate)

Defendant respectfully requests the following relief, based on the undisputed factual record, controlling constitutional authority, and the prosecution’s procedural defaults:

1. Dismiss all charges pursuant to:
   - Penal Code §995 (lack of probable cause),
   - Franks v. Delaware (false affidavit and tainted warrant),
   - Brady v. Maryland (willful suppression of exculpatory evidence),
   - Due process violations under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments;

2. Suppress all evidence derived from the warrant and all post-affidavit investigation, as “fruit of the poisonous tree” under Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963), including but not limited to:
   - The firearm recovered on December 4, 2023,
   - Defendant’s video-recorded statement obtained under coercion,
   - Any derivative reports, paraphrased summaries, or alleged witness corroboration;

3. Strike the District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition as procedurally untimely under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), for failing to timely oppose twenty-three (23) properly served constitutional motions;

4. Issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law under CCP §632 to preserve appellate and federal habeas review, specifically addressing:
   - Brady violations and timeline of redacted/withheld evidence,
   - Fabrications and misstatements in the search warrant affidavit,
   - Chain of custody failures and evidentiary unreliability,
   - Discovery delays and prosecutorial defaults;

5. Sanction the prosecution under California Penal Code §§1054.1–1054.5 for willful suppression of material evidence, failure to comply with informal discovery, and obstructive use of redactions;

6. Take judicial notice of Defendant’s timely filed CCP §170.6 peremptory disqualification, served and filed on March 28, 2025, and enforce it immediately pursuant to Peracchi v. Superior Court (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1245 and People v. Superior Court (Lavi) (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1164;

7. Disqualify Judge Terry A. Bork from presiding over this matter and reassign the case to a neutral judicial officer, as required under CCP §170.6. Judge Bork is now jurisdictionally barred from issuing further rulings or presiding over this matter;

8. If full dismissal is not granted, Defendant reserves the right to seek extraordinary writ relief and federal habeas corpus review under 28 U.S.C. §2254 for violations of:
   - The Sixth Amendment (confrontation and compulsory process),
   - The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (due process),
   - Caperton v. A.T. Massey, 556 U.S. 868 (2009) (bias and structural unfairness).

## X. CONCLUSION

The April 2 discovery and April 3 opposition confirm that this case was built on redacted facts, false narratives, and material omissions. The unredacted police report is now the controlling record, and it refutes the affidavit, the charges, and the DA’s entire theory of guilt.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 4, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
