## DEFENDANT‚ÄôS REPLY TO THE PEOPLE‚ÄôS FAILURE TO OPPOSE MOTION FOR JUDICIAL INQUIRY;  
### SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FROM RECORD;  
### REQUEST FOR FORMAL FINDINGS AND ORDERED RELIEF

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

Defendant respectfully submits this reply in support of his **Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct**, filed on **February 12, 2025**, and as of today‚Äôs date ‚Äî **April 3, 2025** ‚Äî **remains unopposed** by the prosecution.

This reply incorporates the findings and allegations raised in:

- The **Motion to Dismiss for Brady Violations**;
- The **Motion for Sanctions for Prosecutorial Misconduct**;
- The **Motion to Suppress Evidence** under **Franks v. Delaware**;
- The **Motion to Dismiss under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine**.

The **People‚Äôs silence under Rule 8.54(c)** operates as a **waiver of opposition**, and the Court may grant this motion in full.

---

### II. LEGAL WAIVER UNDER RULE OF COURT 8.54(c)

California Rule of Court **8.54(c)** provides:

> *‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù*

No response has been filed by the District Attorney to rebut or contest the allegations of police misconduct, Brady violations, or fabrication. Given the gravity of the issues raised and the People‚Äôs failure to respond, this Court is empowered ‚Äî and obligated ‚Äî to **grant the motion and initiate formal judicial inquiry.**

---

### III. GROUNDS FOR JUDICIAL INQUIRY ARE UNDISPUTED

The motion established, with supporting record evidence, that:

1. **Law enforcement officials coerced or manipulated witness statements**, as evidenced by the contradiction between the warrant affidavit and the sworn Davis affidavit;
2. **Material exculpatory statements** from Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise were **intentionally redacted** from the police report;
3. **Fabrication of probable cause** was used to obtain a search warrant (Franks violation);
4. There is **strong evidence of collusion between law enforcement and the prosecution** to conceal material facts from the defense, the court, and the public.

The above allegations constitute serious violations of:

- **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)** ‚Äì suppression of favorable evidence;
- **Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)** ‚Äì suppression of witness credibility issues;
- **Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995)** ‚Äì state duty to disclose all evidence held by police;
- **Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103 (1935)** ‚Äì knowing use of perjured or falsified evidence;
- **Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991)** ‚Äì coerced statements violate fundamental fairness;
- The **Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause** ‚Äì when government actors conceal or fabricate material evidence.

---

### IV. RELATED MOTIONS CONFIRM WIDESPREAD MISCONDUCT

This reply reaffirms that the misconduct outlined in the Motion for Judicial Inquiry is **not isolated**, but part of a broader pattern substantiated across the docket, including:

- The prosecution‚Äôs **50+ day delay in discovery**, only producing the unredacted report **7 days before trial**;
- **Deliberate redaction** of Davis and Paradise‚Äôs exculpatory statements;
- **Failure to produce chain of custody** documentation for the firearm;
- The DA‚Äôs filing of a **protective order** designed to conceal misconduct;
- Violation of court-ordered **March 28, 2025 meet-and-confer** obligation.

None of these allegations have been rebutted by the prosecution ‚Äî reinforcing the urgency and necessity of judicial oversight and inquiry.

---

### V. THE COURT‚ÄôS AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE IS WELL-ESTABLISHED

This Court is not only empowered but **compelled** to intervene in instances of potential constitutional violations, particularly where the record reflects:

- **Police coercion or falsification** (Mooney, Fulminante);
- **Suppression of material evidence** (Brady, Giglio, Kyles);
- **Prosecutorial concealment** of misconduct.

Where such allegations are substantiated and remain **undisputed**, the Court may:

1. Order **a formal judicial inquiry** under its supervisory authority;
2. Compel full disclosure of all withheld witness statements and investigative records;
3. **Exclude tainted evidence** under **Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961)**;
4. **Dismiss charges** if the integrity of the case has been compromised (Chapman, supra);
5. Issue **referrals or sanctions** against those involved in misconduct.

---

### VI. REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS

To ensure the record is complete for appellate and habeas purposes, Defendant respectfully requests the Court issue written findings confirming:

1. The prosecution failed to oppose this motion under Rule 8.54(c);
2. Allegations of law enforcement coercion, redaction, and fabrication are unrefuted;
3. The redacted report materially suppressed exculpatory witness statements;
4. Law enforcement‚Äôs actions raise substantial questions requiring judicial inquiry;
5. An evidentiary hearing or investigative process is appropriate to assess the full scope of misconduct.

---

### VII. CONCLUSION

The prosecution‚Äôs silence in the face of serious and substantiated constitutional allegations cannot be allowed to stand. The integrity of the judicial process ‚Äî and Defendant‚Äôs due process rights ‚Äî demand this Court act immediately.

Therefore, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

- **Grant the Motion for Judicial Inquiry in full**;
- **Order a formal evidentiary investigation** into all claims of police and prosecutorial misconduct;
- **Compel full disclosure** of all exculpatory and suppressed evidence;
- **Issue written findings** and, if appropriate, **sanctions** to preserve the integrity of the process.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
