### Overview of Reply Brief

This reply brief responds to the District Attorney’s untimely April 3, 2025 Omnibus Opposition. It asserts procedural default under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), and identifies material Brady and Franks violations revealed through unredacted police reports disclosed on April 2, 2025.

The reply also reinforces Defendant’s timely-filed CCP §170.6 motion, which disqualifies Judge Bork as a matter of law and jurisdiction.

### Key Legal Issues Presented

- Untimely opposition filed by DA — violation of Rule 8.54(c)
- Suppressed witness statements (Emmanuel Davis & Melissa Paradise)
- False affidavit allegations (Franks v. Delaware)
- Chain of custody defects (EC §§1400–1402)
- Structural bias and improper denial of CCP §170.6 motion

---

- Dismiss charges under PC §995 and Brady
- Enforce CCP §170.6 and disqualify Judge Bork
- Issue written findings under CCP §632
- Sanction prosecution for Brady and discovery misconduct
