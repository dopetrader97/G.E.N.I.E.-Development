## 📄 1. REVISED BENCH MEMO – Copy & Paste Template

**BENCH MEMO – Final Reply to District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition**  
**Case Name:** People v. Reginald Buddy Ringgold III

### Overview

This bench memo summarizes the Defendant’s Final Reply to the District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition filed on April 3, 2025. The reply identifies:

- The People's procedural default under CRC Rule 8.54(c),
- Suppression of Brady evidence confirmed by the unredacted police report disclosed on April 2, 2025,
- The People's continued withholding of discovery (confirmed in DDA Barnett’s April 3 email),
- Judicial disqualification under CCP §170.6 (filed March 28, 2025) and the Court's failure to enforce it.

The reply also asserts a documented pattern of prosecutorial misconduct consistent with prior findings against LAPD and the Gascón DA administration.

### Key Legal Issues

- DA’s April 3 filing violates CRC Rule 8.54(c)  
- Brady material withheld until April 2 (Davis, Paradise)  
- Franks violation: false affidavit claims refuted by unredacted reports  
- Chain of custody: no logs, transfer records, or authentication  
- Judicial disqualification ignored (CCP §170.6, filed March 28)  
- Discovery still incomplete as of April 3 (Exhibit G – Barnett email)  
- Violation of Court-Ordered Meet and Confer (March 24)  

---

### Requested Relief

- Strike DA’s Omnibus Opposition as untimely  
- Dismiss charges (Brady + PC §995)  
- Suppress tainted evidence (Wong Sun)  
- Grant Franks hearing  
- Enforce CCP §170.6 disqualification  
- Issue written findings under CCP §632  
- Sanction DA’s Office under PC §§1054.1–1054.5
