## DEFENDANTâ€™S OPPOSITION TO UNCHALLENGED SUPPRESSION MOTION;  
### MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH A FALSE AFFIDAVIT;  
### NOTICE OF DEFAULT UNDER RULE 8.54(c);  
### REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS  

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

Defendant respectfully submits this opposition brief and notifies the Court that the **District Attorney has failed to file any timely response** to the Defendantâ€™s properly noticed Motion to Suppress Evidence under **Franks v. Delaware (1978)** and **Penal Code Â§1538.5**.

As of April 3, 2025, **the time to respond has lapsed**, and pursuant to **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**, this Court is empowered to **treat the DAâ€™s silence as a waiver of opposition** and **grant full suppression of all unlawfully obtained evidence**.

---

### II. **LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUPPRESSION**

#### A. **Franks v. Delaware (438 U.S. 154, 1978)**  
A search warrant must be quashed if it is based on **knowingly false or reckless misstatements**. Where a defendant makes a substantial showing of falsity, a **Franks hearing is required**, and if the tainted material is excised and probable cause disappears, **the entire warrant collapses**.

#### B. **Penal Code Â§1538.5**  
All evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded. Under Â§1538.5, this includes **evidence obtained by defective warrant, bad faith, or overreach.**

#### C. **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree â€“ Wong Sun v. United States (371 U.S. 471, 1963)**  
If the foundational warrant is unlawful, then **all derivative evidence â€” including statements, physical items, or digital records â€” must be excluded.**

---

### III. **FACTUAL AND EVIDENTIARY BASIS FOR SUPPRESSION**

#### A. **The Warrant Affidavit Was Materially False**

The **affidavit submitted by Detectives Hall-Fein and Gomez** falsely claimed that witnesses **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise** corroborated the presence of a firearm on November 13.

This is now demonstrably false based on:

- **Davisâ€™s sworn and notarized affidavit (Exhibit A)** explicitly denying any firearm, threat, or criminal behavior.
- **Melissa Paradiseâ€™s forthcoming testimony**, confirming no firearm or threat occurred.
- The **unredacted police report**, disclosed only after 50+ days, proves both statements were **intentionally suppressed**.

These are material facts, not minor errors. **No affidavit can stand when its core claim â€” that a gun was seen or used â€” is completely fabricated.**

#### B. **Law Enforcement Acted in Bad Faith â€“ No Good Faith Exception**

Officers **did not act in objective good faith** (United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984)):

- No independent investigation was conducted.
- The entire affidavit relied on falsified or uncorroborated witness statements.
- The December 4 firearm was recovered via a warrant **built on a lie**, and thus inadmissible.

See also **Illinois v. Gates (1983) 462 U.S. 213** â€“ probable cause must be based on **truthful and reliable information**, not manipulated narratives.

---

### IV. **SUPPRESSION OF STATEMENTS â€“ MIRANDA + COERCION VIOLATIONS**

The District Attorney intends to use the Defendantâ€™s **video-recorded statement**. However:

- There is **no documented Miranda waiver**.
- The statement was allegedly obtained **under duress, coercion, and threat**.
- Portions of the statement were **edited or redacted**, specifically where Defendant **invoked his right to remain silent**.

Under **Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436**, any statement made without proper advisement or waiver must be suppressed.  
See also **People v. Neal (2003) 31 Cal.4th 63** â€“ coerced or involuntary confessions are categorically inadmissible.

---

### V. **CORPUS DELICTI FAILURE â€“ NO INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF A CRIME**

There is **no independent, credible evidence** that a crime occurred on November 13:

- No firearm was recovered in connection with that date.
- No witness supports the claim of a threat.
- The prosecution has failed to establish **corpus delicti** under **People v. Alvarez (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161**.

This failure is fatal to charges like **Penal Code Â§422 (Criminal Threats)** or any possession-related offenses.

---

### VI. **CHAIN OF CUSTODY â€“ CPC Â§Â§1400â€“1402**

The firearm recovered on December 4:

- Is **unrelated to the charged incident**;
- Has **no established nexus** to the Defendant;
- Was logged and transported **without proper documentation**.

Evidence Code Â§Â§1400â€“1402 require strict authentication, and **People v. Jimenez (1978) 22 Cal.3d 595** mandates exclusion when the **chain of custody is compromised.**

---

### VII. **REQUEST FOR WRITTEN JUDICIAL FINDINGS**

To preserve rights for **appellate review and potential federal habeas corpus**, the Defendant respectfully requests that the Court enter written findings on:

1. The DAâ€™s failure to respond under Rule 8.54(c);
2. Suppression of all evidence under Franks v. Delaware and PC Â§1538.5;
3. Miranda/coercion-based suppression of any statements;
4. The lack of corpus delicti and evidentiary nexus for the charges;
5. The breakdown in the chain of custody.

---

### VIII. **CONCLUSION**

The search warrant in this case was fraudulently obtained. The officers acted without lawful authority. The prosecution withheld exculpatory material. The Defendantâ€™s own statements were coerced. And the physical evidence has no credible origin or connection to the alleged offense.

Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests:

- **Suppression of all physical and testimonial evidence obtained via the unlawful warrant**;
- **Suppression of the Defendantâ€™s video statement**;
- **Dismissal of all charges derivative of that evidence**;
- **Written findings placed on the record**.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
