Absolutely‚Äîsmart strategic call. Courts tend to grant government parties a bit more procedural leeway, so switching from ‚Äúdefaulted‚Äù to more precise legal language like **‚Äúfailed to oppose,‚Äù ‚Äúconceded by silence,‚Äù** or **‚Äúwaived opposition‚Äù** keeps your tone professional while preserving the legal weight of their inaction.

Here is your **revised, final version** of the opposition brief, using updated language to reflect that the **prosecution‚Äôs failure to oppose** equates to a **waiver of opposition** under California law, without calling it a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù:

#### *(Escalated Constitutional Challenge Following Franks + Brady + ¬ß995 Violations)*

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork

## DEFENDANT‚ÄôS OPPOSITION TO PROSECUTION‚ÄôS FAILURE TO FILE RESPONSE;  
### MOTION TO DISMISS AS CASE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY TAINTED FROM ORIGIN;  
### REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS UNDER FRANKS, BRADY, ¬ß995, AND RULE 8.54(c)

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

Defendant respectfully submits this opposition and final request for dismissal. The **People have failed to file any timely response** to Defendant‚Äôs previously filed motions, including the:

- Motion to Dismiss under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine;
- Motion to Set Aside the Information under Penal Code ¬ß995;
- Motion to Suppress Evidence under Franks v. Delaware and Penal Code ¬ß1538.5.

As of April 3, 2025, the statutory time period for opposition has passed without any filing by the prosecution. **Under California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**, the Court may deem the prosecution‚Äôs **failure to oppose as a waiver**, and grant all requested relief.

---

### II. **WAIVER OF OPPOSITION ‚Äì RULE 8.54(c)**

**California Rule of Court 8.54(c)** provides:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

By electing not to contest the motion, the prosecution has **conceded the material facts and legal claims presented by the defense**, and **waived its right to challenge suppression and dismissal**.

---

### III. **THE ENTIRE CASE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY CONTAMINATED**

#### A. **Franks Violation ‚Äì The Warrant Is Unlawful**

The affidavit submitted by Detectives Hall-Fein and Gomez falsely claimed that witnesses **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise** confirmed the presence of a firearm. The record now shows:

- Davis‚Äôs **sworn affidavit** categorically denies seeing any weapon or threat;
- The **unredacted police report** corroborates the falsity of the affidavit;
- Paradise‚Äôs expected testimony confirms no weapon or aggression.

Under **Franks v. Delaware (1978) 438 U.S. 154**, when falsehoods are removed from an affidavit and no probable cause remains, **the warrant is void**.

---

#### B. **Wong Sun Doctrine Applies ‚Äì The Entire Case Is Derivative**

Every post-warrant investigative act is tainted:

- Physical evidence (the firearm),
- Video statements taken post-warrant,
- Follow-up reports and investigatory conclusions.

Under **Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)** and **Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975)**, this is inadmissible **fruit of the poisonous tree**. Unless the prosecution can prove a clean, independent source (which they have not even attempted), **the case collapses constitutionally**.

Also controlling:

- **Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984)** ‚Äì tainted evidence cannot be saved absent genuine independence;
- **Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533 (1988)** ‚Äì the independent source doctrine is inapplicable when taint affects all steps in the investigative chain.

---

### IV. **BRADY + ¬ß995 = LACK OF EVIDENTIARY FOUNDATION**

The exculpatory statements of Davis and Paradise were:

- **Intentionally withheld from the redacted discovery**, in violation of **Brady v. Maryland (373 U.S. 83)**;
- Disclosed late, **over 50 days after initial discovery**, seven days before trial;
- Central to refuting the allegation of a criminal threat or weapon possession.

There is no **corpus delicti** for PC ¬ß422 or any firearm-related charge. Under **People v. Alvarez, 27 Cal.4th 1161 (2002)**, the prosecution cannot proceed without evidence independent of the accused‚Äôs statements.

The People's silence amounts to **tacit acknowledgment** that **there is no foundation left to prosecute** under **Penal Code ¬ß995**.

---

### V. **PROSECUTORIAL CONDUCT CONFIRMS THE CASE IS COMPROMISED**

The People:

- Conflated two unrelated incidents (Nov. 13 and Dec. 4) to fabricate a stronger narrative;
- Filed a protective order aimed at limiting defense access to potential police misconduct files;
- Violated the discovery timeline set by this Court (March 28, 2025) and refused to meet and confer.

These acts, taken together, rise to **prosecutorial misconduct** warranting dismissal under **People v. Uribe (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1457**.

---

### VI. **REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS**

Defendant requests the Court enter findings on the record as to:

1. The People‚Äôs failure to file opposition and waiver of challenge under Rule 8.54(c);
2. The suppression of all evidence obtained under the void warrant (Franks);
3. The inadmissibility of all derivative evidence (Wong Sun);
4. The Brady violations, including late and redacted exculpatory evidence;
5. The failure to establish corpus delicti and reasonable or probable cause under ¬ß995;
6. The prosecutorial conduct that further taints the legitimacy of these proceedings.

---

### VII. **CONCLUSION**

This case is not simply weakened ‚Äî it is **constitutionally unprosecutable**. The warrant was built on lies. The evidence was obtained unlawfully. Witnesses deny the core allegations. Brady materials were concealed. And the prosecution has **elected not to oppose** any of these facts or legal grounds.

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

- **Dismiss all charges in their entirety**;
- **Suppress all physical, testimonial, and derivative evidence**;
- **Enter formal judicial findings on the record.**

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
