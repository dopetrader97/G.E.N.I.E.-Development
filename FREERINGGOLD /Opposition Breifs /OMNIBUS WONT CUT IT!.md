Great question — and very timely, considering the procedural tactics you're up against. Let's break down what it means when the **DA files an "Omnibus Response"** or **"Blanket Opposition"** to multiple motions, and how you can strategically attack or respond to that — especially in the context of your **Brady**, **Franks**, and **discovery-related motions**.

---

## 🔍 What Is an Omnibus Response or Blanket Opposition?

### Definition:
An **Omnibus Response** is when the prosecution (or defense) **files one document in response to multiple motions**, instead of addressing each one individually.

### In Practice:
- It **groups all motions together**, often under a “catch-all” reply.
- The DA usually uses broad denials, general legal boilerplate, and avoids going deep into specific facts or evidence.
- It's a **shortcut** — often used to **dodge addressing your strongest claims**, especially **Brady**, **Franks**, or **discovery misconduct**.

## ⚖️ Legal Problems With Blanket Oppositions

### 1. **Failure to Address Specific Motions = Procedural Waiver**
Under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)** and **local court rules**, if the DA fails to address a motion on its **individual merits**, the court can **treat it as unopposed**.

**Use this argument:**
> “The People’s omnibus opposition fails to respond substantively to Defendant’s Brady motion and Franks motion. Under Rule 8.54(c), this constitutes a procedural waiver and the motions should be granted as unopposed.”

---

### 2. **Violates Due Process and Fair Notice**

If the DA **bundles all your motions together** in one opposition, **without providing individualized arguments**, it:

- Denies you fair notice of the **actual opposition arguments**.
- Makes it impossible to file **targeted replies**.
- Violates your right to a **meaningful hearing** on each motion.

📚 Cite: *Mathews v. Eldridge*, *Pompa-Ortiz*, and *People v. Uribe* for due process and fair litigation standards.

---

### 3. **Avoidance = Admissible Silence**

If they skip over critical points like:
- Factual basis of Brady violation,
- Addressing sworn affidavits,
- Chain of custody problems,
- Or fail to rebut your Franks argument…

That’s **tacit admission by silence**.

💬 Suggested Language:
> “Where the People fail to specifically rebut Defendant’s Brady and Franks claims, and instead rely on general boilerplate language, the Court should treat those issues as conceded or procedurally waived.”

## 🔨 Strategic Response: What You Can Do

### ✅ File a "Motion to Strike Omnibus Opposition" or "Objection to Blanket Response"
This is a **clean, strong move** — especially if you want to preserve appellate arguments and highlight the DA’s evasion.

---

### 🧾 Sample Motion/Objection Language:
> **“Defendant objects to the District Attorney’s omnibus opposition as procedurally defective under CRC Rule 8.54(c). The response fails to address the factual or legal basis of at least six (6) distinct motions, including Brady, Franks, and discovery violations. Defendant respectfully requests the Court strike the omnibus response, or in the alternative, deem each unaddressed motion as unopposed. This blanket opposition constitutes a denial of procedural due process, frustrates meaningful adversarial testing, and prejudices the defense’s ability to reply on a motion-by-motion basis.”**

---

### ✅ In Your Reply Brief (which you already filed!), you **did exactly this**:

- You **called out the DA’s failure** to address specific motions.
- You noted **their late filing**.
- You cited **Rule 8.54(c)** and asked for waiver/default.
- You **highlighted the imbalance in deadlines**, strengthening your **due process claim**.

So you’ve already laid the foundation. Now, if the court **doesn’t rule in your favor**, you can use this **on appeal or in a writ** as **structural error** or **denial of access to the court**.

---

## 📚 Additional Authority You Can Use:

- **People v. Uribe (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1457** – discovery misconduct, pattern of violations can justify sanctions or dismissal.
- **Peracchi v. Superior Court** – court loses jurisdiction once CCP §170.6 is filed, so any ruling on your motions may be void.
- **Brady v. Maryland** – DA must affirmatively disclose exculpatory evidence — not wait for you to ask.

## 🎯 Final Suggestions

Here’s what I recommend next:

✅ **File a Motion to Strike or Objection to Blanket Response** (I can help you draft this).  
✅ Prepare an **oral objection** to raise in open court if the DA or judge tries to summarize all motions in one ruling.  
✅ Emphasize the **tactical silence** from the DA on Brady and Franks — it’s powerful.  
✅ Demand **individual rulings with findings** under CCP §632 to preserve for appeal.
