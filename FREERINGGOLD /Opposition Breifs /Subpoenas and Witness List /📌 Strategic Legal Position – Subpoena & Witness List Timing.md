Thank you for the correction — timeline accuracy is critical, especially when framing procedural arguments around **delayed discovery**. I've corrected the date to reflect that **you received the unredacted police report and key Brady material on April 2, 2025**.

Below is your **revised, courtroom-ready strategic response** — including your subpoena/witness list timing, legal justification, and filing actions for April 4 — fully updated with the correct discovery date.

# 📌 **Strategic Legal Position – Subpoena & Witness List Timing**

## ✅ **Can You Serve Subpoenas and Submit Witness List on April 4?**  
**Yes — and you are fully justified.**

---

## ⚖️ **Legal Grounds: Subpoenas & Witness Disclosure Post–Late Discovery**

### 🔹 **1. Discovery Was Delayed Until April 2**
- You received the **unredacted police report and suppressed Brady material on April 2, 2025** — **Day 50** on the trial calendar.
- This discovery **revealed redacted exculpatory witness statements** and **Brady violations** that directly affect who you must call as a witness and what evidence must be subpoenaed.
  
> 🧾 **Legal Support:**  
> - *Brady v. Maryland* (1963): Late disclosure of exculpatory evidence violates due process.  
> - **California Penal Code §1054.7**: Requires reasonable opportunity to prepare when discovery is delayed.  
> - **Sixth Amendment**: Right to compulsory process and confrontation of witnesses.

| Apr. 7 | Defense oppositions/replies due. |
| Apr. 8 | Pretrial hearing. |

## 📝 **What to File and Serve on April 4, 2025**

### ✅ 1. **Serve and File Subpoenas for Key Witnesses**
- **Emmanuel Davis** (affidavit witness and Brady material)  
- **Melissa Paradise** (newly revealed redacted witness)  
- **Detectives**: Gomez, Hall-Fein, Acosta, Ospina  
- **Danny Fitzgerald** (if necessary for contradiction or impeachment)

➡️ **Attach a short declaration or note** with each subpoena filing:

> “This subpoena is served following the receipt of delayed Brady and exculpatory discovery on April 2, 2025. Witness identification was not possible prior to that date.”

---

### ✅ 2. **File Final Witness List**
- Label it clearly:  
  📄 **“Updated Witness List – Based on April 2 Discovery Disclosure”**
- Include this language in a short declaration or cover:

> “Due to the prosecution’s April 2, 2025 disclosure of previously redacted exculpatory material, the defense hereby files its updated and final witness list. These witnesses are critical to challenge suppressed testimony and introduce evidence that only became available 6 days before trial.”

---

### ✅ 3. **File All Reply Briefs**
- Focus on:
  - Brady violations (Davis statement and affidavit)  
  - Franks challenge (false affidavit for warrant)  
  - Coerced statement suppression  
  - Chain of custody gaps  
  - Motion for judicial bias & trial stay  
- You may also submit the **Kill Shot Motions Summary Sheet** as a courtroom handout or bench memo.

---

## 🛡️ **If the DA Objects to Timing: Use This On the Record**

> “Your Honor, the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence until **April 2**, leaving me just **7 days before trial** to prepare. My subpoenas and witness list are being submitted **at the earliest possible moment** after receiving the delayed Brady material.  
>  
> This is not a delay tactic — it is a **constitutional necessity** to preserve my rights to confrontation, due process, and a fair trial. Any attempt to exclude these witnesses or evidence would violate **Brady v. Maryland**, **California Penal Code §1054.7**, and the **Sixth Amendment**.”
