| **Paradise**    | Direct exam – Brady/Probable Cause     | Show she wasn’t threatened, contradicts key witness |
| **Fitzgerald**  | Direct exam – Misunderstanding narrative | Undermines DA’s foundation of threats |

# 🎯 DIRECT EXAMINATION — DEFENSE WITNESSES

## 🔹 **Emmanuel Davis – Exculpatory Witness (Franks / Brady)**

> “Mr. Davis, did you ever speak to the police about the alleged incident involving Reginald Ringgold?”  
> “Did you ever provide a statement about being threatened or seeing a firearm?”  
> “Did you ever feel threatened by Mr. Ringgold on the day in question?”  
> “What did you actually witness that morning?”  
> “Did you observe Mr. Ringgold try to calm the situation down?”  
> “Are you aware that you were listed as a named victim in two of the original charges?”  
> “Did you authorize that? Were you even contacted?”  
> “Did you sign the affidavit you provided to the defense?”  
> “Is everything in that affidavit true to the best of your knowledge?”  
>  
> ✅ *Purpose:* Prove false affidavit + DA suppressed known exculpatory material

---

## 🔹 **Melissa Paradise – Eyewitness Suppressed (Brady)**

> “Ms. Paradise, were you present on the evening of November 13, 2023, during the alleged incident?”  
> “Did anyone threaten you or pull a firearm?”  
> “Did you feel scared or endangered in any way?”  
> “Did you speak to any law enforcement officers about what you saw?”  
> “Has anyone from the DA’s office contacted you prior to this week?”  
> “Can you tell the court what you actually witnessed that evening?”  
> “Was Mr. Ringgold escalating the situation — or trying to resolve it?”  
>  
> ✅ *Purpose:* Show she was ignored, would’ve undermined warrant/charges

---

## 🔹 **Danny Fitzgerald – Context + Impeachment Witness**

> “Mr. Fitzgerald, do you recall exchanging text messages with Mr. Ringgold regarding the events of November 13?”  
> “Were you under the impression there was a serious threat or weapon involved?”  
> “After those messages, did you and Mr. Ringgold come to an understanding?”  
> “Did you at any time report seeing a firearm or being threatened?”  
> “Have you seen your messages being included in the prosecution’s discovery until just recently?”  
>  
> ✅ *Purpose:* Undermine “victim” narrative + prove text messages were late discovery

---

# ❌ CROSS-EXAMINATION – PROSECUTION OFFICERS

## 🔸 **Cross for Det. Hall-Fein (Affiant on Warrant)**

> “Detective, you were the affiant on the search warrant in this case, correct?”  
> “In your affidavit, did you state that Mr. Davis and Ms. Paradise were threatened by Mr. Ringgold?”  
> “Did you ever speak to either of them before signing the affidavit?”  
> “So you presented secondhand claims as sworn fact without confirming them?”  
> “Were you ever made aware that Mr. Davis had not been interviewed — yet was listed in two charges?”  
> “Did you include his lack of participation or denial of involvement in your report?”  
> “You’re aware that failure to include known facts can invalidate a warrant under **Franks v. Delaware**, correct?”  
>  
> ✅ *Purpose:* Trigger Franks ruling → suppression of all derivative evidence

---

## 🔸 **Cross for Chain of Custody / Suppression**

> “Were you the officer who found the firearm?”  
> “Can you tell the court where exactly it was found?”  
> “Do you have photographs or video of the firearm at the moment it was recovered?”  
> “Where was it logged into evidence, and at what time?”  
> “Have you produced the full chain of custody report?”  
> “Can you confirm whether any fingerprints or DNA were collected?”  
> “Was this firearm connected to Mr. Ringgold in any way through forensic testing?”  
>
