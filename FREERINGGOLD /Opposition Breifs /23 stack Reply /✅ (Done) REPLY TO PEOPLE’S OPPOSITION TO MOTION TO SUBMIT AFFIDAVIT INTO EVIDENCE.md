Perfect. Now that I’ve reviewed your **original Motion to Submit Affidavit into Evidence**and the supporting **Exhibit List with Davis’s affidavit**— here’s how we tighten and finalize your **Reply Brief to the DA’s Opposition**.

---

### 🔍 Quick Recap: What Your Original Motion Raised
- You argued **Emmanuel Davis’s affidavit is exculpatory**, material, and admissible.
- You cited constitutional rights under **Brady**, **Giglio**, **Kyles**, and **Chambers**.
- You invoked **Evidence Code §§ 240, 1220, and 1230** (unavailability + statements against interest).
- You made it clear: the affidavit is for **pretrial use**, not trial evidence.

### 🟥 What the DA said (Omnibus §II.B):
> “Accordingly, the People oppose any attempt to introduce evidence via affidavit or declaration, whether sworn and notarized or otherwise, without an opportunity for cross-examination.”

They failed to:

**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Submit the Sworn Affidavit of **Emmanuel Davis** into Evidence (filed February 14, 2025).

The People object solely on hearsay grounds, citing a lack of cross-examination. However, they do not:

- Challenge the **authenticity** of the affidavit;
- Deny the **truthfulness** of Davis’s statements;
- Dispute that Davis is a **material exculpatory witness**;
- Acknowledge that they **never disclosed** Davis's account to the Court or in discovery.

This is not an evidentiary technicality — this is a **Brady violation disguised as an objection**.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION FAILS TO REBUT THE MOTION

Your motion is legally supported by:

- *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)  
- *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419 (1995)  
- *Chambers v. Mississippi*, 410 U.S. 284 (1973)  
- *Washington v. Texas*, 388 U.S. 14 (1967)  
- **California Evidence Code §§ 240, 1220, and 1230**

The People’s opposition ignores:

- The **constitutional obligation** to disclose and allow presentation of material defense evidence;
- Your efforts to obtain Davis’s live testimony, including:
  - Motion to Subpoena (Feb. 14);
  - SUBP-002 subpoena (March 7);
  - Emergency Motion to Compel Testimony (March 27).

Their silence is not a legal defense — it is **admission by omission**.

---

## III. THE COURT HAS DISCRETION TO ADMIT THIS AFFIDAVIT PRETRIAL

This is not a trial motion. It is a **pretrial submission** in support of:

- Brady motions;
- Franks hearing;
- §995 dismissal.

Per **Evidence Code §240**, a sworn statement is admissible where a witness is unavailable due to governmental or prosecutorial interference.

Here:

- The prosecution ignored Davis;
- Withheld his account;
- Dropped the charges he was associated with;
- Then objected when you tried to introduce his affidavit.

That violates *Kyles*, *Brady*, and *Pompa-Ortiz*.

---

## IV. THE AFFIDAVIT IS MATERIAL — AND THE PEOPLE NEVER DENY THAT

Davis affirms:

- He saw **no gun**;
- He heard **no threats**;
- Defendant tried to **de-escalate**.

That directly contradicts the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant and establish probable cause. This makes the affidavit **critical pretrial evidence**, and the Court must either:

- Admit it;
- Or compel Davis’s appearance before trial.

Otherwise, the Court would be allowing the State to suppress exculpatory evidence **twice** — once in discovery, and again in court.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Admit the **sworn, notarized affidavit** of Emmanuel Davis (Exhibit A to motion filed 2/14/25) as pretrial evidence for:
   - Brady purposes;
   - Franks evaluation;
   - §995 dismissal or evidentiary suppression;
2. Alternatively, compel Davis’s **live testimony** before trial under the subpoena already served;
3. Declare that the DA’s objection is **procedurally and constitutionally insufficient**;
4. Issue written findings under CCP §632 to preserve this issue for appellate and federal review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The Court cannot allow a system where the State:

- Suppresses a witness;
- Ignores a subpoena;
- And then objects to the defense using that witness’s affidavit — all while claiming due process is intact.

The People do not dispute what Davis said. They just want the Court to pretend it doesn’t exist. That is not justice — it’s concealment by procedure.

The Court must admit the affidavit or compel the witness. To do otherwise would deny the Defendant the right to present the truth.

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO SUBMIT AFFIDAVIT INTO EVIDENCE**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.B)**

---

### 🧠 What This Motion Does:

- Seeks to admit the **sworn, notarized affidavit** of **Emmanuel Davis**, a material exculpatory witness;
- Invokes Brady, Giglio, Kyles, and Evidence Code §§240, 1220, 1230;
- Argues that the affidavit is admissible and essential to the defense, particularly in a **pretrial setting** (Brady / Franks / §995).

---

### 🔍 What the DA Said in Omnibus §II.B:

> “Accordingly, the People oppose any attempt to introduce evidence via affidavit or declaration, whether sworn and notarized or otherwise, without an opportunity for cross-examination.”

🟥 Translation: They don’t contest the **truth** of the affidavit — they just object to the **form**.

What they’re really saying is:  
> “We suppressed this witness, we won’t call him, but you can’t use his statement either.”

That’s not just procedurally unfair — it’s a **Brady and due process violation**.

Let’s reply and end this right. 🔨

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Submit the Affidavit of **Emmanuel Davis** into Evidence.

The DA objects solely on hearsay grounds — claiming that without cross-examination, the affidavit cannot be used. They do **not challenge**:

- The authenticity of the affidavit;
- The truth of Davis’s sworn statements;
- The fact that Davis’s statement contradicts probable cause;
- The relevance of Davis’s testimony to the defense.

This is not an evidentiary technicality — it is a **Brady violation** in motion.

---

## II. THE DAVIS AFFIDAVIT IS MATERIAL, EXCULPATORY, AND CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

The affidavit states that:

- **No gun was seen**;
- **No threats were made**;
- Defendant was **attempting to de-escalate**, not commit a crime.

This directly undermines the charges related to criminal threats and firearm possession. The People knew Davis contradicted their narrative — and:

- Never disclosed his statement in discovery;
- Quietly dropped counts involving him;
- Never interviewed or acknowledged his version in their affidavit or police reports.

That is **intentional Brady suppression**.

---

## III. THE DA CANNOT SUPPRESS A WITNESS AND THEN CLAIM YOU CANNOT USE HIS AFFIDAVIT

Defendant:

- Filed a **Motion to Subpoena Davis** (Feb. 14);
- Filed a **judicially stamped subpoena (SUBP-002)** (March 7);
- Filed an **Emergency Motion to Compel Davis’s Testimony** (March 27).

The DA:

- Never moved to quash;
- Never offered Davis for cross-examination;
- Never disclosed **any internal reports** contradicting his affidavit.

They **created the unavailability** — and now use it to object.

That violates *Chambers v. Mississippi*, *Washington v. Texas*, and *Brady v. Maryland*. Suppressing a witness and then objecting to their affidavit is **fundamentally unfair**.

---

## IV. THE COURT MAY ADMIT THE AFFIDAVIT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW

Even if the Court were to evaluate this under the **Evidence Code**, there are exceptions:

- **§1220** – Admission of party opponent;
- **§1230** – Declaration against interest;
- **§240** – Prior sworn statement when witness is unavailable due to prosecutorial or governmental interference.

The affidavit is **not being offered in place of live trial testimony** — it is being submitted **pretrial**, in support of Brady, Franks, and suppression motions, and to build the due process record.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Admit the **sworn affidavit of Emmanuel Davis** as pretrial evidence for:
   - Brady motions;
   - Franks challenges;
   - §995 dismissal;
   - Pretrial evidentiary rulings;
2. Alternatively, compel the People to produce Davis for testimony or deposition;
3. Find that the **DA waived opposition** to the substance of the affidavit under Rule 8.54(c);
4. Issue written findings under CCP §632 to preserve this issue for appellate and federal review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The People do not deny the truth of Davis’s sworn statement. They do not dispute that he refutes their charges. They just want the Court to ignore him.

That’s not evidentiary law — it’s a **Brady violation and a denial of the right to present a defense**.

The Court must admit the affidavit, or compel Davis’s testimony. To do otherwise would let the prosecution bury the very evidence that disproves their case.
