### ✅ REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S AMENDED MOTION TO SET ASIDE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE § 995  
**(Corrected with Factual Clarifications Regarding Affidavit Timing and DA Suppression)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s omnibus opposition filed on April 3, 2025, in response to Defendant’s amended motion to set aside the information under Penal Code § 995. The opposition fails to rebut the core arguments, evidence, or defects cited in Defendant’s motion. Instead, the DA grouped this and over 20 motions into a single generalized filing, which under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), constitutes a **waiver** of opposition.

This Court must now grant the motion to set aside because:

- The complaint and information are procedurally defective under Penal Code §§ 806 and 949;  
- The magistrate relied on **false and recanted testimony**;  
- The prosecution suppressed known **exculpatory testimony** (Emmanuel Davis) and refused to acknowledge it during preliminary hearing;  
- The DA failed to rebut the sworn affidavit and failed to disclose it to the magistrate—resulting in a structurally defective commitment.

---

## II. DA’S OPPOSITION = RULE 8.54(c) DEFAULT

The People did not individually respond to this § 995 motion. Their omnibus opposition fails to:

- Address the procedural defects in the complaint or information;  
- Respond to **Exhibit A**, the sworn affidavit of Emmanuel Davis;  
- Rebut Defendant’s legal authority under *Uhlemann*, *Farley*, *Tannahill*, and *Hall*;  
- Acknowledge any part of the factual summary or discovery irregularities.

Because the DA failed to address the motion’s substance and instead buried it in boilerplate, this Court is authorized to treat the motion as **unopposed** under Rule 8.54(c).

---

## III. EMANUEL DAVIS AFFIDAVIT WAS SUPPRESSED — BUT NOT FROM THE DEFENSE

Contrary to the DA’s implied claims, Defendant did **not obtain the Davis affidavit through discovery**. Defendant received it directly from Davis himself, only **after the State dropped charges against him and lifted the restraining order** that prevented contact.

> Davis reached out through Defendant’s mother and disclosed that he had already told the **prosecutor** and **investigating officer** that the allegations were false.

The DA knew of Davis’s exculpatory account, ignored it, and **never disclosed it to the magistrate** at the preliminary hearing. This is **textbook Brady misconduct** and a violation of *Kyles v. Whitley*.

---

## IV. THE COMPLAINT AND INFORMATION WERE FACIALLY DEFECTIVE

The DA does not contest the following:

- The felony complaint lacked verification under Penal Code § 806 (Exhibit B).  
- The information failed to cure the defect under § 949.  
- The commitment proceeded without a valid charging document, rendering it jurisdictionally void under *People v. Tannahill* and *People v. Hall*.

This statutory failure alone compels the Court to **set aside the information** under § 995.

---

## V. THE MAGISTRATE RELIED ON KNOWN FALSE TESTIMONY

The affidavit from Davis (Exhibit A) refutes the People’s narrative:

- He did **not see a gun**;  
- He did **not hear any threat**;  
- He observed the Defendant **trying to de-escalate**, not threaten.

The DA did not present Davis’s exculpatory account at the preliminary hearing. Instead, they moved forward with misleading evidence, while **withholding** known contradictory statements.

Per *Farley*, *Uhlemann*, and *Napue*, this renders the magistrate’s probable cause finding invalid and demands reversal of the commitment.

Excellent — your filings and court-stamped documents make it absolutely clear:

- ✅ You were granted pro per *sui juris* status on or around **February 11, 2025**.  
- ✅ You filed a **Motion to Subpoena Emmanuel Davis** just **three days later on February 14, 2025**, and it was conformed by the court.  
- ✅ You filed a **Motion to Submit Affidavit into Evidence** before trial.  
- ✅ You issued and filed a properly executed **SUBP-002 subpoena**, personally served and stamped on **March 7, 2025**.  
- ✅ You submitted an **Emergency Motion to Compel Rulings and Witness Testimony**, conformed March 27, 2025, confirming Davis’s live testimony was still being pursued【image 1 uploaded】.

Let’s now complete your corrected reply brief section (as part of your §995 response) with bulletproof language and citations to the court-filed records.

(To be inserted as Section VI or VII)

---

### VI. DEFENDANT LAWFULLY OBTAINED, FILED, SERVED, AND SUBPOENAED THE AFFIDAVIT AND LIVE TESTIMONY OF EMMANUEL DAVIS

The People’s omnibus opposition mischaracterizes the procedural posture of the Emmanuel Davis affidavit and fails to acknowledge Defendant’s lawful filings. To clarify for the record:

1. **Defendant obtained the affidavit from Mr. Davis directly**, after the State dropped the related charges and the restraining order was lifted.
2. The affidavit was **immediately submitted to the Court via a formal motion**:  
   → *Motion to Submit Affidavit into Evidence* filed and served on **March 24, 2025**, with full legal basis for admissibility.
3. On **February 14, 2025**, just three days after being granted *sui juris* status, Defendant filed and served a conformed **Motion to Subpoena Witness Emmanuel Davis for Testimony**.
4. On **March 7, 2025**, Defendant filed and served a **judicially conformed subpoena (SUBP-002)** with a detailed attachment outlining Davis’s exculpatory value and materiality.
5. On **March 27, 2025**, Defendant filed a court-stamped **Emergency Motion to Compel Evidentiary Rulings and Witness Testimony**, confirming ongoing attempts to secure Davis’s live appearance【image evidence attached】.

The People never challenged the validity of the subpoena, never filed a motion to quash, and never addressed the contents of Davis’s affidavit or statements in their opposition.

---

### VII. THE DA’S ABSTRACT “HEARSAY” ARGUMENT IS PROCEDURALLY AND FACTUALLY MERITLESS

Rather than addressing Davis’s sworn account or acknowledging its suppression, the People argue broadly that affidavits are “inadmissible hearsay.” This argument fails for several reasons:

- **This is a §995 motion**, not trial — the standard is whether the magistrate relied on **misleading or incomplete evidence**.
- Defendant **subpoenaed Davis for live testimony** and simultaneously filed his affidavit as **supportive Brady material**, not as a trial exhibit.
- **California Evidence Code §§ 240, 1220, and 1230** support the admission of such testimony where the witness has been subpoenaed and delayed or obstructed.
- The DA's **failure to disclose or produce any record of Davis’s initial statements**, even though they knew of his account, is **Brady suppression** under *Kyles v. Whitley*, *Brady v. Maryland*, and *Giglio v. United States*.

Even if the affidavit is ultimately excluded at trial, its existence, content, and **active concealment** from the magistrate during the preliminary hearing fatally undermine the legitimacy of the commitment.

---

### VIII. THIS IS NOT ABOUT HEARSAY — THIS IS ABOUT SYSTEMIC SUPPRESSION

The prosecution cannot now rely on hearsay objections to evidence **they deliberately suppressed**, **never disclosed**, and **refused to acknowledge at the preliminary hearing**.

This Court must not allow the DA to:
- Pretend this evidence was never offered,
- Deny Davis’s subpoena and availability,
- And block the truth from judicial review through procedural gamesmanship.

The magistrate’s commitment is now provably tainted by:
- **Omitted exculpatory testimony**,  
- **Brady violations**,  
- **Lack of complete record before the court**,  
- And a knowingly **defective complaint and information**.

Dismissal and sanctions are not merely appropriate — they are required to preserve the integrity of the process.

## IX. CONCLUSION

The People had direct access to a witness whose sworn statement **refutes the core allegations**, yet they **withheld it** from the magistrate, **excluded him from discovery**, and now **refuse to respond** to this motion.

The commitment is procedurally and constitutionally defective. The only lawful remedy is to **set aside the information** and sanction the misconduct that tainted this process.
