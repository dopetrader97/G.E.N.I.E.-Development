### ✅ REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S AMENDED MOTION TO SET ASIDE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE § 995  
**(Corrected with Factual Clarifications Regarding Affidavit Timing and DA Suppression)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s omnibus opposition filed on April 3, 2025, in response to Defendant’s amended motion to set aside the information under Penal Code § 995. The opposition fails to rebut the core arguments, evidence, or defects cited in Defendant’s motion. Instead, the DA grouped this and over 20 motions into a single generalized filing, which under California Rule of Court 8.54(c), constitutes a **waiver** of opposition.

This Court must now grant the motion to set aside because:

- The complaint and information are procedurally defective under Penal Code §§ 806 and 949;  
- The magistrate relied on **false and recanted testimony**;  
- The prosecution suppressed known **exculpatory testimony** (Emmanuel Davis) and refused to acknowledge it during preliminary hearing;  
- The DA failed to rebut the sworn affidavit and failed to disclose it to the magistrate—resulting in a structurally defective commitment.

---

## II. DA’S OPPOSITION = RULE 8.54(c) DEFAULT

The People did not individually respond to this § 995 motion. Their omnibus opposition fails to:

- Address the procedural defects in the complaint or information;  
- Respond to **Exhibit A**, the sworn affidavit of Emmanuel Davis;  
- Rebut Defendant’s legal authority under *Uhlemann*, *Farley*, *Tannahill*, and *Hall*;  
- Acknowledge any part of the factual summary or discovery irregularities.

Because the DA failed to address the motion’s substance and instead buried it in boilerplate, this Court is authorized to treat the motion as **unopposed** under Rule 8.54(c).

---

## III. EMANUEL DAVIS AFFIDAVIT WAS SUPPRESSED — BUT NOT FROM THE DEFENSE

Contrary to the DA’s implied claims, Defendant did **not obtain the Davis affidavit through discovery**. Defendant received it directly from Davis himself, only **after the State dropped charges against him and lifted the restraining order** that prevented contact.

> Davis reached out through Defendant’s mother and disclosed that he had already told the **prosecutor** and **investigating officer** that the allegations were false.

The DA knew of Davis’s exculpatory account, ignored it, and **never disclosed it to the magistrate** at the preliminary hearing. This is **textbook Brady misconduct** and a violation of *Kyles v. Whitley*.

---

## IV. THE COMPLAINT AND INFORMATION WERE FACIALLY DEFECTIVE

The DA does not contest the following:

- The felony complaint lacked verification under Penal Code § 806 (Exhibit B).  
- The information failed to cure the defect under § 949.  
- The commitment proceeded without a valid charging document, rendering it jurisdictionally void under *People v. Tannahill* and *People v. Hall*.

This statutory failure alone compels the Court to **set aside the information** under § 995.

---

## V. THE MAGISTRATE RELIED ON KNOWN FALSE TESTIMONY

The affidavit from Davis (Exhibit A) refutes the People’s narrative:

- He did **not see a gun**;  
- He did **not hear any threat**;  
- He observed the Defendant **trying to de-escalate**, not threaten.

The DA did not present Davis’s exculpatory account at the preliminary hearing. Instead, they moved forward with misleading evidence, while **withholding** known contradictory statements.

Per *Farley*, *Uhlemann*, and *Napue*, this renders the magistrate’s probable cause finding invalid and demands reversal of the commitment.

---

## VI. STRUCTURAL PREJUDICE FROM SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE

Davis’s statement was not part of the discovery received before the preliminary hearing. It only came to light due to direct outreach by Davis himself, not from prosecution disclosure.

The DA’s failure to correct or reveal this to the magistrate constitutes:

- **Brady** suppression;  
- **Due process violation**;  
- **Material omission** that undermined the fairness of the hearing.

When a magistrate is **denied access to critical, known exculpatory evidence**, the commitment cannot stand. The preliminary hearing becomes legally unreliable.

---

## VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Strike the DA’s omnibus opposition** as to this motion under Rule 8.54(c);  
2. **Deem the motion unopposed** and grant full relief under § 995;  
3. **Set aside the information** due to lack of probable cause and statutory defect;  
4. **Suppress all evidence** obtained through this flawed process;  
5. **Dismiss the charges** in the interest of justice under Penal Code § 1385;  
6. **Impose sanctions** under Penal Code § 1054.5 for Brady violations;  
7. **Order production** of all internal communications concerning Davis’s statements;  
8. **Issue written findings** under CCP § 632 for appellate preservation.

---

## VIII. CONCLUSION

The People had direct access to a witness whose sworn statement **refutes the core allegations**, yet they **withheld it** from the magistrate, **excluded him from discovery**, and now **refuse to respond** to this motion.

The commitment is procedurally and constitutionally defective. The only lawful remedy is to **set aside the information** and sanction the misconduct that tainted this process.
