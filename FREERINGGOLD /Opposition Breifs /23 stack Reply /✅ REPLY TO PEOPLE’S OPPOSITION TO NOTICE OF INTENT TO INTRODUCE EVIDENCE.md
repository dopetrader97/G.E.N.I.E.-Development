# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER THE FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE DOCTRINE – SUPPLEMENTAL OR REASSERTED FORM**  
*(If you filed more than one motion under this doctrine or clarified/expanded it in later filings — e.g., discovery violations + firearm issues + witness suppression + tainted affidavit.)*

---

### 🔍 Background:

You may have filed:
- One early **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree motion** (already addressed in Reply #6 ✅), and...
- A **supplemental or reasserted version** (explicitly targeting *Wong Sun*, discovery misconduct, and evidence connected to Brady/Franks violations — such as a renewed filing post–March 24 after discovery dump).

The DA likely grouped it into their omnibus “already responded elsewhere” default. We're going to hammer that.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s non-substantive opposition to Defendant’s **Supplemental Motion to Dismiss Under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine**.

The motion seeks dismissal of charges and exclusion of all derivative evidence stemming from:

- A warrant based on a **materially misleading affidavit**;
- **Suppressed exculpatory witness statements**;
- **Late discovery disclosures** (over 1,300 pages);
- A firearm whose chain of custody remains **unproduced**.

The People’s opposition does not engage with the motion’s legal basis or factual substance. Instead, they summarily refer to prior filings and claim the motion is “duplicative.” That’s not law — it’s **waiver** under Rule 8.54(c).

---

## II. THIS MOTION IS DISTINCT — AND NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE RECORD

This motion does not simply repeat arguments — it **synthesizes** all constitutional violations into a **clear causal chain** that triggers *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963):

> “Evidence obtained by exploitation of a constitutional violation must be excluded.”

That includes:

- The firearm;
- All photos taken at or after its seizure;
- Police narratives tied to the firearm;
- Ballistics or lab tests performed post-recovery;
- Officer statements referencing or relying on suppressed witness omissions.

This motion ties the *Franks*, *Brady*, and **discovery misconduct** into one coherent theory of tainted evidence.

---

## III. THE DA’S FAILURE TO REBUT IS A CONCESSION

The People fail to:

- Dispute the **omission of Davis and Paradise** from the warrant affidavit;
- Dispute that Davis **contradicted probable cause**;
- Dispute that 1,300+ pages were withheld until **April 2–3, 2025**;
- Offer any **ballistic, forensic, or chain-of-custody documentation** for the firearm.

Instead, they argue that these issues were “already addressed” — but never cite:

- **Wong Sun**;
- **Pompa-Ortiz**;
- **Sandlin**, **Lopez**, or **Leon**.

They refuse to meet the motion on the law. That is waiver.

---

## IV. ALL EVIDENCE CONNECTED TO THE WARRANT IS TAINTED AND INADMISSIBLE

Under *Wong Sun*, *Franks*, and *People v. Sandlin* (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1310:

> If the warrant is invalid, the search and all evidence flowing from it must be suppressed.

Here, the warrant was issued based on a **false impression of probable cause**, created by:

- The omission of Davis’s exculpatory account;
- The failure to disclose Paradise’s presence;
- A single narrative never tested, never challenged, and **never verified**.

Without those facts, there would have been **no probable cause**.

Thus, the evidence is fruit of the poisoned tree — and inadmissible.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Dismiss all charges derived from the warrant, including those involving the firearm;
2. Suppress the firearm and any lab work, reports, or testimony derived therefrom;
3. Exclude officer testimony tainted by reliance on false or incomplete affidavit information;
4. Preserve the record under CCP §632 and Penal Code §1538.5(i).

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The People have not rebutted this motion.

They cannot prove the tree wasn’t poisoned. They cannot explain the omissions. They cannot show unbroken chain of custody. And they cannot pretend the discovery delay was harmless.

When the root is poisoned — the fruit cannot be served.

The Court must dismiss or suppress all tainted evidence.
