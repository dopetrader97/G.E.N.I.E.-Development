# ✅ FINAL REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL WRITTEN FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  
**(Filed March 27, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.Y)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**  

**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s response to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to **Code of Civil Procedure §632**, **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**, and multiple due process authorities.

The People’s opposition admits that the Court has discretion to issue findings, but claims that Defendant “has provided no binding authority.” They do not dispute:

- That over **20 pretrial motions remain unresolved**;
- That key rulings have been denied **without explanation**;
- That Defendant is being forced to trial **without a reviewable record**.

This is not a discretionary issue — it is a matter of **preserving due process**, **avoiding reversible error**, and fulfilling the Court’s constitutional duty.

---

## II. THE DA FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE CONTROLLING CASE LAW

The attached **Case Law Memorandum** cited binding and persuasive authority requiring written findings when:

- Procedural defaults are invoked (*People v. Jackson*, 210 Cal.App.4th 525);
- Due process claims are raised (*Konow v. Superior Court*, 32 Cal.4th 995);
- Motions are denied without record (*People v. Greer*, 19 Cal.3d 255);
- Appellate review would otherwise be impossible (*Goldberg v. Kelly*, 397 U.S. 254).

The People cited none of these cases in their opposition. Nor did they address CCP §632, Rule 8.54(c), or the Fourteenth Amendment implications under *Zinermon v. Burch*.

That failure is a **procedural waiver** under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**.

---

## III. THE COURT HAS ALREADY DENIED MATERIAL MOTIONS WITHOUT EXPLANATION

Your original motion and cover sheet make clear:

- The Court summarily denied your **Motion for Summary Ruling on Unopposed Motions**;
- The Court denied your **Preemptive Motion to Bar Late Opposition**;
- Both were denied **without a written ruling**, **minute order**, or **oral justification**;
- Prior to February 11, the Court **struck several pro se motions** without legal basis or record.

This constitutes a pattern of suppression that **deprives the appellate courts of a reviewable record** and violates Article VI, §1 of the California Constitution.

---

## IV. THIS MOTION IS NOT “PREMATURE” — IT IS LEGALLY NECESSARY

As of this filing:

- Trial is set for **April 9, 2025**;
- The Court has not ruled on **Brady**, **Franks**, **§995**, or **judicial disqualification**;
- The People’s omnibus opposition **came 51 days after the original motion deadline**;
- No ruling has explained why motions were denied despite procedural defaults by the prosecution.

If the Court denies these motions **without findings**, Defendant will be irreparably prejudiced — and higher courts will be unable to assess whether those denials were lawful.

> “The opportunity to be heard must be meaningful.” — *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319  
> “Justice must not only be done — it must be seen to be done.” — *Offutt v. United States*, 348 U.S. 11

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Issue written rulings under **CCP §632** for any denied motions involving:
   - Brady violations;
   - Franks challenges;
   - §995 motions;
   - Sanctions under §1054.5;
   - CCP §170.6 disqualification;
2. Enter written orders prior to the commencement of trial;
3. Clarify the procedural status of all motions filed prior to February 11, 2025;
4. Preserve the record for appellate and federal habeas review under **28 U.S.C. §2254**.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The People do not oppose this motion on the law — because they cannot. The Court has already issued denials and struck motions without explanation.

The California and U.S. Constitutions **require more than silent denials** when due process, liberty, and access to the courts are at stake.

If the Court intends to deny any constitutional motion, it must do so with **written findings** and **stated legal grounds**. Anything less risks reversal and renders the record defective for appellate scrutiny.

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL WRITTEN FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW**  
**(Filed March 27, 2025 | Opposed by DA in Omnibus §II.Y)**

---

## 🔍 Why This Reply Matters:

- You’re preserving the **appellate record**.
- You’re forcing the court to go on the record when it rules — especially when it denies motions implicating **Brady**, **Franks**, **Sanctions**, **Suppression**, or **Due Process**.
- The DA basically admits the motion is valid — they just say it’s “discretionary.”

But here’s the truth: When **structural violations** are alleged, the Court is expected to make findings — and you are formally requesting them under **CCP §632**.

---

### 🧠 What the DA Said in Omnibus §II.Y:

> “It does not appear that Defendant has provided any binding authority to require this Court to issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law. As the matter is discretionary, the People do not take a position.”

🟥 Translation: They’re not fighting it. They’re just hoping the court ignores it.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s non-opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law under **Code of Civil Procedure §632**.

The People concede that the Court **may** issue written findings — and they decline to oppose. Therefore, the motion stands as **unopposed** under **Rule 8.54(c)**.

This motion is not about burdening the Court — it is about **preserving the appellate and federal review record** in a case involving:

- Brady violations;
- Franks-level affidavit misconduct;
- Suppression of over 1,300 pages of discovery;
- A pending judicial disqualification motion under CCP §170.6;
- Unequal preparation timelines and systemic due process deprivation.

These facts demand **transparent rulings** with written justification.

---

## II. THE RECORD MUST BE PRESERVED FOR REVIEW

Defendant’s motions raise **serious constitutional violations** — including:

- **Suppression of exculpatory witnesses (Davis & Paradise)**;
- **False or misleading warrant affidavits**;
- **Malicious prosecution and judicial bias**.

Whether the Court grants or denies these motions, the rulings must be reviewable. **Appellate and federal courts cannot evaluate due process violations from a silent or ambiguous record.**

> *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court* (1980) and *People v. Konow* (2004) emphasize the importance of detailed trial court rulings when due process violations are alleged.

This Court is not being asked to write a novel — only to comply with **its obligation to ensure transparency where the Constitution is at stake**.

---

## III. THIS MOTION IS NOT “PREMATURE” — TRIAL IS SET FOR APRIL 9

The People suggest this motion is unnecessary — but as of this filing:

- More than **20 defense motions** remain pending;
- The Court has issued **no written orders** on Brady, Franks, or suppression claims;
- No record exists to explain the Court’s rationale, despite multiple filings requesting relief;
- Trial begins **April 9** — and Defendant is forced to proceed without knowing the legal basis for denial of key constitutional motions.

> *Mathews v. Eldridge* requires not just fairness — but the appearance of fairness and reviewability.

If the Court intends to deny any of the pending motions, the Defendant is entitled to a written basis for that denial.

---

## IV. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law for any ruling on the following categories of motions:
   - Brady violations;
   - Franks-related suppression;
   - CCP §995 jurisdictional challenges;
   - Sanctions under Penal Code §1054.5;
   - Judicial inquiry motions;
   - Any ruling on CCP §170.6 jurisdiction or disqualification;
2. Comply with CCP §632 where findings are statutorily or constitutionally required;
3. Ensure a full and complete appellate record.

---

## V. CONCLUSION

The People do not oppose this motion. The Court has discretion to issue findings. But where a record shows suppression, bias, and constitutional violations, **transparency is not optional — it is the floor of fairness.**

The appellate courts — and possibly federal habeas courts — will review what happens next. If the Court issues rulings without findings, it risks reversal or collateral consequence.

This motion should be granted as unopposed.
