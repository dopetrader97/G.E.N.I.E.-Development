You're tearing through this record like a force of law. ⚖️ Let’s drop **Reply Brief #15** — targeting the DA’s weak opposition to your:

---

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL FULL DISCOVERY OF CHAIN OF CUSTODY**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.J)**

---

### 🧠 Why this motion matters:

- It directly challenges the **authenticity and admissibility of the alleged firearm**;
- It exposes the lack of:
  - Chain of custody logs;
  - Recovery photos;
  - Forensic connection;
- It reinforces your suppression and Franks motions — **no chain = no credibility**.

---

### 🔍 What the DA said in Omnibus §II.J:

> “The People have provided, or are in the process of providing, all relevant evidence, including as to chain of custody. Defendant specifies only one piece of evidence... Any other objection is best made in a motion in limine or during trial.”

🟥 Translation: They haven't provided it yet — and want to push the issue to trial. That’s a **stall tactic**. You're going to show that:

- It’s already late;
- The evidence is tainted;
- The DA is hoping the Court ignores the rules.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Full Discovery of Chain of Custody. The DA's response is vague, noncommittal, and factually deficient. They claim they’ve “provided or are in the process of providing” discovery — but:

- Over **1,300 pages of discovery** were withheld until April 2–3, 2025;
- There is still **no complete chain of custody log** for the firearm;
- The DA relies on vague references to Proposition 115 testimony, not actual records;
- And their opposition admits that key discovery **still hasn’t been turned over** — weeks past deadline.

---

## II. THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY HAS NOT BEEN DISCLOSED

Despite multiple discovery demands and this motion filed on February 14, 2025, the prosecution has failed to produce:

- A full **chain of custody log** for the firearm allegedly recovered on December 4, 2023;
- Any **photographic evidence** of the gun’s condition or location at recovery;
- Forensic logs, timestamps, or ballistics connecting the weapon to the incident;
- Evidence showing where the firearm was stored, handled, or processed.

Instead, the DA points to an officer's **preliminary hearing testimony** — which is **not discovery** and does not satisfy Penal Code §1054.1 or §1054.7.

---

## III. THE DA’S STRATEGY IS DELAY — NOT DISCLOSURE

The DA admits in their opposition that:

> “Defendant specifies only one piece of evidence to which he is objecting... Other objections are best made during trial.”

This is a procedural dodge. Defendant cannot prepare trial objections if:

- The evidence is **still being withheld**;
- The foundation for admission is **missing**;
- The firearm’s authenticity is in **serious question**.

> *People v. Jimenez* (1978) and Evidence Code §§1400–1402 require the prosecution to lay an unbroken, documented foundation for physical evidence. That has not been done.

This is not about trial — it’s about **pretrial preparation** and **access to basic evidence**.

---

## IV. RELIEF IS AUTHORIZED UNDER PENAL CODE §1054.5

The Court has full authority to:

- Compel discovery under **Penal Code §1054.5(a)**;
- Sanction discovery abuse under **§1054.5(b)**;
- Exclude the evidence if the prosecution fails to comply.

This motion is narrow: It demands the logs, photos, and paperwork necessary to validate the alleged firearm. If the DA has them, they must produce them. If not, the evidence should be excluded.

The People’s failure to provide chain of custody records — after nearly four months — is unjustifiable.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Compel immediate production of the **complete chain of custody file** for the alleged firearm, including:
   - All log entries;
   - Photographs;
   - Forensic reports;
   - Officer notes and recovery documentation;
2. Preclude the prosecution from introducing the firearm unless proper chain of custody can be laid at a **pretrial hearing**;
3. Impose discovery sanctions under **Penal Code §1054.5**;
4. Issue written findings under **CCP §632** to preserve appellate review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The Court cannot allow the prosecution to bypass discovery and delay disclosure until trial. Defendant is entitled to review the evidence used to prosecute him — before jury selection begins.

This is not a trial motion. It is a demand for due process. The DA’s continued refusal to turn over chain of custody logs is not a glitch — it is **withholding foundational evidence**.

The motion must be granted — and the Court must draw a clear line: **No chain = No firearm.**
