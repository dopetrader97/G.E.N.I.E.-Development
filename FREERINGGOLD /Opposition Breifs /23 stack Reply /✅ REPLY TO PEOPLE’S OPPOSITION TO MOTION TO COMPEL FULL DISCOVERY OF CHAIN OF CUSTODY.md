Perfect. Based on your original **Motion to Compel Full Discovery of Chain of Custody**, the DA’s **Omnibus Opposition**, and your clarification that:

- The firearm photos were only disclosed on the **50th day** of the discovery timeline (not when this motion was filed);
- The gun was recovered over **two weeks after the alleged incident**;
- It has **no direct connection** to the alleged conduct on November 13, 2023;
- You **still do not have** full chain of custody discovery to this day;

I’ve revised your reply to reflect this accurately — while making it tighter, stronger, and more procedurally focused.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Full Discovery of Chain of Custody.

The DA’s response fails to confront the actual relief sought. They claim the chain of custody issue should be resolved at trial and that they’ve provided the relevant materials. In fact, they:

- Disclosed partial discovery **50 days into the statutory discovery clock**, not when this motion was filed;
- Have **not** disclosed a complete and continuous chain of custody;
- Produced undated and unexplained photos of a firearm allegedly recovered **weeks after the alleged offense**, in a vehicle **not registered to Defendant**, with no forensic linkage.

The DA offers no timelines, no itemized logs, and no verification that the weapon has been properly handled, stored, tested, or even documented in a legally admissible form.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO REBUT THE LEGAL FOUNDATION OF THE MOTION

The DA fails to address the controlling case law and statutes cited in your motion:

- *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) – Material evidence affecting credibility or admissibility must be disclosed;
- *People v. Jimenez*, 22 Cal.3d 595 (1978) – Chain of custody must be verified or the evidence is inadmissible;
- *Trombetta v. California*, 467 U.S. 479 (1984) – Government has duty to preserve evidence central to defense;
- Evidence Code §§ 1400–1402 – Evidence must be authenticated before it is admissible;
- Penal Code §§ 1054.1–1054.5 – Mandate timely and full discovery.

The People cite none of these authorities. They merely argue that objections should be made at trial — which misstates both the law and the nature of this motion.

---

## III. THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE LATE, INCOMPLETE, AND LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT

The prosecution disclosed photographs of a firearm:

- **On the 50th day** of the discovery timeline — well after this motion was filed and after the DA was already in violation of discovery deadlines;
- Without any accompanying **chain of custody report**, **evidence tags**, **timestamps**, or **officer field notes**;
- That document a weapon recovered **weeks after the November 13 incident**, from a vehicle **not linked to Defendant**, and **never mentioned in real-time reports**.

These photos were produced without explanation of:

- Where the firearm was between the date of seizure and the date of photography;
- Who handled it;
- Whether any forensic testing was done;
- Or how it is even connected to the charges.

This is precisely why **complete chain of custody discovery is required now — not at trial**.

---

## IV. PUSHING THIS TO TRIAL VIOLATES DUE PROCESS

The People argue that objections to the firearm’s authenticity or foundation should be raised during trial. But that violates both statutory discovery obligations and due process rights under *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), which requires that:

> “The opportunity to be heard must be afforded at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”

Waiting until trial to assess whether the evidence is admissible, relevant, or lawfully obtained is **too late** — especially when Defendant is still being denied access to the foundational documentation necessary to prepare his defense.

---

## V. DEFENDANT STILL HAS NOT RECEIVED A COMPLETE CHAIN OF CUSTODY FILE

To date, the People have failed to provide:

- A continuous **log of evidence movement** (i.e., who booked it, when, where, and how);
- Lab reports, if any;
- Booking photos or timestamped video of the alleged recovery;
- Internal LAPD chain logs or reports that link the firearm to the original incident or the charges.

The DA’s refusal to even address these deficiencies in their opposition — while asking the Court to push the issue to trial — undermines the fairness and legality of the prosecution.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Compel the People to produce the **complete chain of custody file** for the alleged firearm, including:
   - Recovery location documentation;
   - Log entries from initial seizure through present storage;
   - Forensic testing and handling records;
   - Officer narratives directly linking the gun to this case;
2. Order a **pretrial evidentiary hearing** on the integrity of the firearm’s chain of custody;
3. Preclude introduction of the firearm at trial unless the People comply with Penal Code §1054.1 and Evidence Code §1400;
4. Impose sanctions under Penal Code §1054.5 for unjustified discovery delay;
5. Issue written findings under CCP §632 to preserve this matter for appellate review.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The prosecution's failure to produce timely, verifiable chain of custody documentation is not harmless — it strikes at the heart of evidentiary reliability.

Their “we’ll deal with it at trial” response ignores both statutory discovery deadlines and your fundamental right to prepare a defense. The firearm evidence remains tainted, unverified, and legally vulnerable unless full disclosure is compelled now.

This motion must be granted. No foundation. No firearm.

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL FULL DISCOVERY OF CHAIN OF CUSTODY**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.J)**

---

### 🧠 Why this motion matters:

- It directly challenges the **authenticity and admissibility of the alleged firearm**;
- It exposes the lack of:
  - Chain of custody logs;
  - Recovery photos;
  - Forensic connection;
- It reinforces your suppression and Franks motions — **no chain = no credibility**.

---

### 🔍 What the DA said in Omnibus §II.J:

> “The People have provided, or are in the process of providing, all relevant evidence, including as to chain of custody. Defendant specifies only one piece of evidence... Any other objection is best made in a motion in limine or during trial.”

🟥 Translation: They haven't provided it yet — and want to push the issue to trial. That’s a **stall tactic**. You're going to show that:

- It’s already late;
- The evidence is tainted;
- The DA is hoping the Court ignores the rules.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Full Discovery of Chain of Custody. The DA's response is vague, noncommittal, and factually deficient. They claim they’ve “provided or are in the process of providing” discovery — but:

- Over **1,300 pages of discovery** were withheld until April 2–3, 2025;
- There is still **no complete chain of custody log** for the firearm;
- The DA relies on vague references to Proposition 115 testimony, not actual records;
- And their opposition admits that key discovery **still hasn’t been turned over** — weeks past deadline.

---

## II. THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY HAS NOT BEEN DISCLOSED

Despite multiple discovery demands and this motion filed on February 14, 2025, the prosecution has failed to produce:

- A full **chain of custody log** for the firearm allegedly recovered on December 4, 2023;
- Any **photographic evidence** of the gun’s condition or location at recovery;
- Forensic logs, timestamps, or ballistics connecting the weapon to the incident;
- Evidence showing where the firearm was stored, handled, or processed.

Instead, the DA points to an officer's **preliminary hearing testimony** — which is **not discovery** and does not satisfy Penal Code §1054.1 or §1054.7.

---

## III. THE DA’S STRATEGY IS DELAY — NOT DISCLOSURE

The DA admits in their opposition that:

> “Defendant specifies only one piece of evidence to which he is objecting... Other objections are best made during trial.”

This is a procedural dodge. Defendant cannot prepare trial objections if:

- The evidence is **still being withheld**;
- The foundation for admission is **missing**;
- The firearm’s authenticity is in **serious question**.

> *People v. Jimenez* (1978) and Evidence Code §§1400–1402 require the prosecution to lay an unbroken, documented foundation for physical evidence. That has not been done.

This is not about trial — it’s about **pretrial preparation** and **access to basic evidence**.

---

## IV. RELIEF IS AUTHORIZED UNDER PENAL CODE §1054.5

The Court has full authority to:

- Compel discovery under **Penal Code §1054.5(a)**;
- Sanction discovery abuse under **§1054.5(b)**;
- Exclude the evidence if the prosecution fails to comply.

This motion is narrow: It demands the logs, photos, and paperwork necessary to validate the alleged firearm. If the DA has them, they must produce them. If not, the evidence should be excluded.

The People’s failure to provide chain of custody records — after nearly four months — is unjustifiable.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Compel immediate production of the **complete chain of custody file** for the alleged firearm, including:
   - All log entries;
   - Photographs;
   - Forensic reports;
   - Officer notes and recovery documentation;
2. Preclude the prosecution from introducing the firearm unless proper chain of custody can be laid at a **pretrial hearing**;
3. Impose discovery sanctions under **Penal Code §1054.5**;
4. Issue written findings under **CCP §632** to preserve appellate review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The Court cannot allow the prosecution to bypass discovery and delay disclosure until trial. Defendant is entitled to review the evidence used to prosecute him — before jury selection begins.

This is not a trial motion. It is a demand for due process. The DA’s continued refusal to turn over chain of custody logs is not a glitch — it is **withholding foundational evidence**.

The motion must be granted — and the Court must draw a clear line: **No chain = No firearm.**
