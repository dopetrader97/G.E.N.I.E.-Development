# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER THE FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE DOCTRINE**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed by DA in Omnibus §II.M)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine. The motion seeks to exclude and dismiss all evidence derived from:

- A **materially misleading warrant affidavit**;
- **Suppressed exculpatory witness statements**;
- And **post-search conduct** stemming from unconstitutional discovery tactics.

The People offer no factual or legal opposition. Instead, they summarily categorize the motion as a “hybrid” and refer the Court to their boilerplate responses to separate motions (Omnibus §II.M). This is not a lawful response — it is a **waiver** under California Rule of Court **8.54(c)**.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO OPPOSE THIS MOTION ON THE MERITS

The DA's omnibus opposition:

- Does not cite a single legal authority in opposition;
- Does not address **Wong Sun v. United States**, the controlling authority;
- Does not deny the **existence of tainted derivative evidence**;
- Does not rebut the motion’s central claim — that the firearm, the warrant, and the reports following the search are the **product of a false affidavit** and **Brady suppression**.

This is not an opposition. It is **silence in legal form** — and must be treated as such.

---

## III. THIS MOTION IS NOT DUPLICATIVE — IT SEEKS DISMISSAL UNDER A DISTINCT LEGAL DOCTRINE

The **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine** is a standalone Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment principle. It is **not limited to motions to suppress**, and it goes beyond *Franks* and Penal Code §1538.5.

> “Evidence obtained by exploitation of a constitutional violation must be excluded.”  
> — *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)

This motion seeks to **dismiss** charges — not just suppress evidence — because:

- The foundational probable cause was fabricated;
- The search was executed based on a **false and incomplete affidavit**;
- Witnesses were actively suppressed, violating **Brady**, **Giglio**, and **Kyles**;
- All evidence recovered — the firearm, the photo logs, subsequent reports — are legally tainted.

## IV. THE WARRANT AFFIDAVIT WAS FRAUDULENT AND FATALLY TAINTED

Detective Hall-Fein’s warrant affidavit:

- **Omitted material facts**: that Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise contradicted the State’s version;
- **Failed to disclose** that Davis was no longer a cooperating victim;
- **Failed to include or investigate** Paradise’s account, despite her being listed by the complaining witness.

This wasn’t an oversight. It was a **Franks-level omission** — and now the DA asks the Court to pretend it never happened.

> But if the "tree" — the affidavit — was poisoned, then so is every fruit it bore.

That includes:

- The firearm allegedly found on December 4;
- The chain of custody reports;
- The booking photographs;
- The subsequent police narratives that rely on that evidence;
- Any statements referencing the seized firearm.

---

## V. THE PEOPLE CANNOT CURE THIS WITH A “GOOD FAITH” DEFENSE

The DA has previously invoked *United States v. Leon* (good faith exception), but **Leon does not apply** where the affidavit itself was:

- **Deceptive** by omission;
- **Based on incomplete or suppressed witness accounts**;
- And **presented without any effort to verify or investigate key facts**.

A warrant issued on false grounds — or with reckless disregard for truth — is **void**, and no amount of “good faith” by the executing officers can revive it. See:

- *Franks v. Delaware*, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)  
- *People v. Sandlin*, 230 Cal.App.3d 1310 (1991)  
- *People v. Sanchez*, 63 Cal.4th 665 (2016)

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant dismissal** of all charges derived from the December 4, 2023 search;
2. Suppress the **firearm**, **photos**, **statements**, and **chain of custody documents**;
3. Issue written findings under **Penal Code §1538.5(i)** and **CCP §632**;
4. Acknowledge this as part of a broader pattern of prosecutorial misconduct;
5. Preserve the record for appeal and federal habeas relief.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine is not a metaphor — it is binding constitutional law.

When the root is poisoned — through deception, omission, or suppression — the entire evidentiary record becomes infected. The prosecution cannot launder tainted facts through discovery delay and then claim procedural innocence.

This Court must dismiss the derivative evidence — and the charges that relied on it — to preserve the integrity of this process.
