**Dept.: 128**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s **Supplemental Motion to Suppress Evidence under Penal Code §1538.5**, filed on March 7, 2025.

The motion raises **new constitutional violations and deficiencies** discovered after the initial motion, including:

- **Material omissions** in the warrant affidavit;
- **Brady violations** that tainted probable cause;
- A complete lack of **chain of custody or forensic linkage** to the firearm;
- Late discovery of exculpatory and evidentiary materials, days before trial.

The People’s response is a **single conclusory paragraph** — claiming that no "cognizable deficiencies" exist. They cite no law, no facts, and offer no rebuttal to the *Franks* or *Brady* standards. This is a procedural **waiver under Rule 8.54(c)**.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO ADDRESS THE SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION’S LEGAL STANDARD

This is not a rehash of prior suppression arguments. It is a direct challenge to the **validity of the warrant itself**, based on **new facts**, **newly received discovery**, and **affirmative constitutional claims** under:

- *Franks v. Delaware*, 438 U.S. 154 (1978);  
- *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963);  
- *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419 (1995);  
- *People v. Sandlin*, 230 Cal.App.3d 1310 (1991).

The DA does not cite **any** of these cases, and offers **no substantive opposition**. That is a concession — not a response.

---

## III. THE WARRANT AFFIDAVIT CONTAINED MATERIAL OMISSIONS – FRANKS STANDARD IS MET

Detective Hall-Fein’s affidavit, used to obtain the warrant, was **materially incomplete and misleading**:

- It **excluded known witness Emmanuel Davis**, who later provided a sworn affidavit stating:
  - He saw no firearm;
  - He heard no threats;
  - Defendant tried to de-escalate the situation.

- It also **excluded Melissa Paradise**, present at the scene, who is prepared to testify that:
  - No gun was visible;
  - No threats were made;
  - The alleged victim’s account was false.

These omissions meet both prongs of *Franks*:

1. **Reckless disregard for truth** by omitting material facts;
2. **No probable cause** exists if the affidavit had included those facts.

> Under *Franks*, if a warrant is issued based on misleading or incomplete facts, all evidence derived from it must be suppressed.

---

## IV. THE PROSECUTION WITHHELD BRADY MATERIAL THAT WOULD HAVE INVALIDATED THE WARRANT

The DA failed to disclose:

- Any notes, recordings, or summaries of Davis’s communications with law enforcement;
- Paradise’s presence at the scene — **despite being named by the complaining witness**;
- Over 1,300 pages of discovery, turned over on April 2–3, 2025, **after the opposition deadline** and weeks after discovery was due.

These are **clear Brady violations**, and they directly impact the validity of the warrant. If Davis’s and Paradise’s accounts had been disclosed, the magistrate would not have found probable cause.

That poisons the warrant — and all evidence stemming from it.

---

## V. THIS WARRANT IS THE ROOT OF THE POISONOUS TREE

As established in *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963):

> "Evidence obtained as a result of a constitutional violation must be excluded unless the taint is purged."

Here, the firearm was:

- Found **weeks after the incident**;
- Not connected to Defendant by forensic testing;
- Introduced without **photos, logs, or foundational chain of custody**;
- Recovered based on a **warrant that would not have existed but for omitted facts**.

All evidence stemming from that warrant — including the firearm, photos, chain of custody, and derivative reports — must be suppressed.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Hold a **Franks hearing** to assess the material omissions in the warrant affidavit;
2. Suppress the firearm and all derivative evidence under *Franks*, *Wong Sun*, and Penal Code §1538.5;
3. Strike the People’s opposition under Rule 8.54(c) as procedurally insufficient;
4. Issue written findings under CCP §632 to preserve the record for appellate review.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The DA’s one-paragraph opposition does not contest the facts. It does not cite the law. It does not engage with the motion. That’s not litigation — that’s evasion.

This warrant was obtained through **falsehood and omission**, not facts and law. The firearm and everything that followed it must be suppressed.

The motion is unrebutted. The record is clear. The Court must act.

**Dated:** April 4, 2025  
**Respectfully submitted,**

**“Without Prejudice”**  
**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
Defendant, *In Sui Juris*
