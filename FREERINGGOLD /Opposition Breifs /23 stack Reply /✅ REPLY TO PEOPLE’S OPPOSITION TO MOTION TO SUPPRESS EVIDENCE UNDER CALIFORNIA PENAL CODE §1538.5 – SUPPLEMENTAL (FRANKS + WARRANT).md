Excellent. I’ve reviewed your original **Motion to Suppress under Penal Code §1538.5**, and here's what we need to do next:

### 🎯 Your Goal:
We’re ensuring your **Reply Brief to the DA’s opposition** is:
- **Targeted** to what you actually raised in the motion;
- **Not redundant** with your Franks or Brady reply briefs;
- **Comprehensive** where the DA glossed over facts and failed to engage with controlling law.

---

### ✅ Key Points from Your Original Motion:

1. **Franks violations**: The warrant was obtained using false/misleading information;
2. **Leon doesn’t apply**: Officers acted in bad faith, didn’t investigate independently;
3. **Brady violations**: The State suppressed exculpatory witness statements (Davis & Paradise);
4. **Chain of custody**: No verified link between you and the recovered firearm;
5. **Vehicle search invalid**: You had no ownership or control of the vehicle;
6. **Request for suppression of all evidence** derived from the search.

---

### 🔍 What the DA said in Omnibus §II.T:

> “Defendant does not specify any cognizable ‘deficiencies’ or constitutional violations warranting judicial relief. Accordingly, the People oppose the instant motion.”

🟥 **That’s not an opposition**. That’s evasion.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence under Penal Code §1538.5.

The DA fails to respond to the core legal bases and facts raised in the motion, including:

- Violations of *Franks v. Delaware* and *Brady v. Maryland*;
- Application of *United States v. Leon* and why it does **not** protect this warrant;
- Failure to address your lack of ownership/control over the searched vehicle;
- No chain of custody or forensic linkage to the firearm allegedly recovered.

Their non-response is a **waiver under Rule 8.54(c)** and an implicit concession that the prosecution **cannot justify the seizure** under constitutional or statutory law.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS FOR SUPPRESSION

Your motion raised **8 independent grounds** for suppression. The People addressed **none** of them specifically.

| Ground for Suppression | DA’s Response | Problem |
|-------------------------|---------------|---------|
| False affidavit (Franks) | Ignored | Waiver |
| Bad faith (Leon exception) | Ignored | Waiver |
| Brady witness suppression | Ignored | Waiver |
| Chain of custody issues | Ignored | Waiver |
| Lack of nexus to vehicle | Ignored | Waiver |
| Search exceeded scope | Ignored | Waiver |

This is not a close call — it is **total procedural failure** by the prosecution.

---

## III. THE WARRANT WAS INVALID UNDER FRANKS AND LEON

### A. Franks Violations:
Detective Hall-Fein’s affidavit excluded:

- Exculpatory statements from **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise**;
- Material facts that contradict the allegations in the complaint;
- Any effort to verify the alleged victim’s claims.

These are textbook *Franks* omissions that **destroy probable cause**.

### B. Leon’s Good Faith Exception Does Not Apply:
Per *United States v. Leon*, the good faith exception only applies when officers **reasonably rely** on a facially valid warrant.

But here:

- Officers ignored material inconsistencies;
- Relied on a single, biased statement without corroboration;
- Acted recklessly in omitting material exculpatory facts.

Their conduct **precludes Leon** from saving the warrant.

---

## IV. THE SEARCH OF THE VEHICLE WAS UNLAWFUL

You clearly stated — and the DA does not dispute — that:

- The vehicle was **not owned, registered, or controlled** by you;
- You had **no lawful or constructive possession** of the contents;
- The warrant authorized a search based on **alleged residence**, not vehicle ownership.

This violates *People v. Jenkins*, 140 Cal.App.4th 805 (2006), and renders the firearm evidence inadmissible.

---

## V. BREAKS IN THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY MAKE THE EVIDENCE UNRELIABLE

The DA failed to rebut that:

- There is **no photographic documentation** of the firearm at the scene;
- No verified **chain of custody logs** have been disclosed;
- No **ballistic testing or forensic evidence** links the firearm to you;
- The search occurred **weeks after the alleged incident**, breaking any continuity.

Per *People v. Jimenez*, 22 Cal.3d 595 (1978), the lack of foundational reliability mandates exclusion.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Hold a Franks hearing;
2. Suppress all evidence seized as a result of the unlawful search;
3. Rule that the Leon good faith exception does not apply;
4. Exclude any evidence derived from the searched vehicle;
5. Preclude introduction of the firearm due to lack of foundation;
6. Issue written findings under CCP §632 and Penal Code §1538.5(i) for appellate review.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The DA’s opposition doesn’t respond to the law, the facts, or the motion. It is **non-opposition** in form and substance.

The record is clear:

- The warrant was based on omissions and deception;
- The vehicle search lacked lawful foundation;
- The firearm is unverified and improperly linked;
- The DA still hasn’t produced chain of custody documentation.

All evidence must be suppressed.

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE UNDER PENAL CODE §1538.5**  
**(Filed March 7, 2025 | Opposed by DA in Omnibus §II.T)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s **Supplemental Motion to Suppress Evidence under Penal Code §1538.5**, filed on March 7, 2025.

The motion raises **new constitutional violations and deficiencies** discovered after the initial motion, including:

- **Material omissions** in the warrant affidavit;
- **Brady violations** that tainted probable cause;
- A complete lack of **chain of custody or forensic linkage** to the firearm;
- Late discovery of exculpatory and evidentiary materials, days before trial.

The People’s response is a **single conclusory paragraph** — claiming that no "cognizable deficiencies" exist. They cite no law, no facts, and offer no rebuttal to the *Franks* or *Brady* standards. This is a procedural **waiver under Rule 8.54(c)**.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO ADDRESS THE SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION’S LEGAL STANDARD

This is not a rehash of prior suppression arguments. It is a direct challenge to the **validity of the warrant itself**, based on **new facts**, **newly received discovery**, and **affirmative constitutional claims** under:

- *Franks v. Delaware*, 438 U.S. 154 (1978);  
- *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963);  
- *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419 (1995);  
- *People v. Sandlin*, 230 Cal.App.3d 1310 (1991).

The DA does not cite **any** of these cases, and offers **no substantive opposition**. That is a concession — not a response.

---

## III. THE WARRANT AFFIDAVIT CONTAINED MATERIAL OMISSIONS – FRANKS STANDARD IS MET

Detective Hall-Fein’s affidavit, used to obtain the warrant, was **materially incomplete and misleading**:

- It **excluded known witness Emmanuel Davis**, who later provided a sworn affidavit stating:
  - He saw no firearm;
  - He heard no threats;
  - Defendant tried to de-escalate the situation.

- It also **excluded Melissa Paradise**, present at the scene, who is prepared to testify that:
  - No gun was visible;
  - No threats were made;
  - The alleged victim’s account was false.

These omissions meet both prongs of *Franks*:

1. **Reckless disregard for truth** by omitting material facts;
2. **No probable cause** exists if the affidavit had included those facts.

> Under *Franks*, if a warrant is issued based on misleading or incomplete facts, all evidence derived from it must be suppressed.

---

## IV. THE PROSECUTION WITHHELD BRADY MATERIAL THAT WOULD HAVE INVALIDATED THE WARRANT

The DA failed to disclose:

- Any notes, recordings, or summaries of Davis’s communications with law enforcement;
- Paradise’s presence at the scene — **despite being named by the complaining witness**;
- Over 1,300 pages of discovery, turned over on April 2–3, 2025, **after the opposition deadline** and weeks after discovery was due.

These are **clear Brady violations**, and they directly impact the validity of the warrant. If Davis’s and Paradise’s accounts had been disclosed, the magistrate would not have found probable cause.

That poisons the warrant — and all evidence stemming from it.

---

## V. THIS WARRANT IS THE ROOT OF THE POISONOUS TREE

As established in *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963):

> "Evidence obtained as a result of a constitutional violation must be excluded unless the taint is purged."

Here, the firearm was:

- Found **weeks after the incident**;
- Not connected to Defendant by forensic testing;
- Introduced without **photos, logs, or foundational chain of custody**;
- Recovered based on a **warrant that would not have existed but for omitted facts**.

All evidence stemming from that warrant — including the firearm, photos, chain of custody, and derivative reports — must be suppressed.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Hold a **Franks hearing** to assess the material omissions in the warrant affidavit;
2. Suppress the firearm and all derivative evidence under *Franks*, *Wong Sun*, and Penal Code §1538.5;
3. Strike the People’s opposition under Rule 8.54(c) as procedurally insufficient;
4. Issue written findings under CCP §632 to preserve the record for appellate review.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The DA’s one-paragraph opposition does not contest the facts. It does not cite the law. It does not engage with the motion. That’s not litigation — that’s evasion.

This warrant was obtained through **falsehood and omission**, not facts and law. The firearm and everything that followed it must be suppressed.

The motion is unrebutted. The record is clear. The Court must act.
