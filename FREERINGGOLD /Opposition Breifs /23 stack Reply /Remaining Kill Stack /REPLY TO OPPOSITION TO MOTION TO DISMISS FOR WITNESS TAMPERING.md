# ✅ FINAL REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS FOR WITNESS TAMPERING  
**(Originally Filed: February 14, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.D–E)**

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork** *(Pending Disqualification under CCP §170.6)*  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**  
**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply is submitted in response to the People’s April 3, 2025 omnibus opposition, which fails to substantively address or rebut the factual and legal grounds supporting Defendant’s motion to dismiss for **witness tampering, suppression, and obstruction**. Instead, the People resort to vague denials and procedural mischaracterizations.

What they do not dispute is fatal:  
- They suppressed material exculpatory evidence from **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise**;  
- They failed to respond to the **subpoena**, **affidavit**, and multiple **motions to compel testimony**;  
- They omitted both witnesses from the **original reports**, **discovery**, and **warrant affidavit**;  
- They filed their opposition **51 days late** and did not directly contest this motion — triggering waiver under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**.

The record now reflects a clear due process and Brady violation. The motion must be granted.

---

## II. DA’S OPPOSITION IS NONRESPONSIVE AND UNTIMELY — RULE 8.54(c) DEFAULT

Rather than responding to the **witness tampering** or **suppression claims**, the DA refers vaguely to its Brady section (§II.D) and makes no individualized rebuttal. That is procedurally insufficient.

Under **CRC Rule 8.54(c)**:  
> “If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”

This motion was filed **February 14, 2025**. The opposition was served **April 3, 2025**, one day before the hearing — and failed to address the substance. The People are in default.

---

## III. EMMANUEL DAVIS — A MATERIAL WITNESS THE STATE TRIED TO ERASE

The motion and supporting declaration show:

- Davis was listed as a **named victim in Counts 2 and 4**;  
- After charges were dismissed and the restraining order lifted, **he contacted Defendant** directly, provided a **sworn affidavit** stating:
  - He saw no firearm;  
  - He heard no threats;  
  - He observed de-escalation by Defendant, not aggression.

- The DA **never disclosed** this affidavit, never included Davis in discovery, and **did not acknowledge** him at preliminary hearing.

Defendant lawfully:
- Subpoenaed Davis (SUBP-002) on **March 7, 2025**;  
- Filed motions on **Feb. 14, March 24, and March 27** to admit the affidavit and compel testimony;  
- Received no opposition, no motion to quash, and **no response whatsoever**.

This is **textbook Brady suppression** and an **independent basis for dismissal**.

---

## IV. MELISSA PARADISE — AN EXCULPATORY WITNESS HIDDEN FROM RECORD

Paradise was:
- Present at the scene, named in the initial police report;  
- Never contacted or interviewed by law enforcement;  
- Willing to testify to **absence of threat, absence of weapon, and lack of fear**.

Yet:
- Her name was **omitted from all redacted/unredacted discovery**;  
- No notes, statements, or reports were disclosed by the DA;  
- She was concealed even after the defense **subpoenaed her appearance**.

This conduct satisfies the **Franks v. Delaware** and **Kyles v. Whitley** thresholds. The People omitted known, material witnesses from both the **charging affidavit** and the **evidentiary record**.

---

## V. THIS IS NOT A HEARSAY ISSUE — IT IS A SUPPRESSION AND OBSTRUCTION ISSUE

The DA vaguely claims these affidavits are “hearsay.” That objection is both procedurally untimely and legally irrelevant:

- This motion concerns **pretrial suppression**, not trial admissibility;  
- Defendant **subpoenaed both witnesses for live testimony**;  
- California Evidence Code §§ **240, 1220, and 1230** provide multiple exceptions for admissibility.

Regardless, it is the **DA’s concealment**, not evidentiary form, that constitutes misconduct.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests the Court:

1. Treat the motion as **unopposed** under CRC Rule 8.54(c);  
2. **Dismiss the Information** for violation of due process, Brady, and Franks;  
3. Suppress all evidence derived from misleading or incomplete affidavits and false omissions;  
4. Order an evidentiary **Franks hearing** on the material omissions;  
5. Impose **sanctions** and issue written findings under CCP §632 for appellate review.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The People never responded to this motion. They never rebutted the **sworn testimony**, **procedural history**, or **constitutional violations**. Their silence is not accidental — it is strategic suppression.

The Court cannot allow a prosecution built on omissions, delays, and concealed witnesses to proceed.

Dismissal is now not only lawful — it is necessary.

**Dated:** April 6, 2025  
**Respectfully submitted,**  
**“Without Prejudice”**
