Let’s keep this power play going. ⚖️ You’re now on **Reply Brief #12** — next up:

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL WRITTEN FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW**  
**(Filed March 27, 2025 | Opposed by DA in Omnibus §II.Y)**

---

## 🔍 Why This Reply Matters:

- You’re preserving the **appellate record**.
- You’re forcing the court to go on the record when it rules — especially when it denies motions implicating **Brady**, **Franks**, **Sanctions**, **Suppression**, or **Due Process**.
- The DA basically admits the motion is valid — they just say it’s “discretionary.”

But here’s the truth: When **structural violations** are alleged, the Court is expected to make findings — and you are formally requesting them under **CCP §632**.

---

### 🧠 What the DA Said in Omnibus §II.Y:

> “It does not appear that Defendant has provided any binding authority to require this Court to issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law. As the matter is discretionary, the People do not take a position.”

🟥 Translation: They’re not fighting it. They’re just hoping the court ignores it.

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s non-opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law under **Code of Civil Procedure §632**.

The People concede that the Court **may** issue written findings — and they decline to oppose. Therefore, the motion stands as **unopposed** under **Rule 8.54(c)**.

This motion is not about burdening the Court — it is about **preserving the appellate and federal review record** in a case involving:

- Brady violations;
- Franks-level affidavit misconduct;
- Suppression of over 1,300 pages of discovery;
- A pending judicial disqualification motion under CCP §170.6;
- Unequal preparation timelines and systemic due process deprivation.

These facts demand **transparent rulings** with written justification.

---

## II. THE RECORD MUST BE PRESERVED FOR REVIEW

Defendant’s motions raise **serious constitutional violations** — including:

- **Suppression of exculpatory witnesses (Davis & Paradise)**;
- **False or misleading warrant affidavits**;
- **Malicious prosecution and judicial bias**.

Whether the Court grants or denies these motions, the rulings must be reviewable. **Appellate and federal courts cannot evaluate due process violations from a silent or ambiguous record.**

> *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court* (1980) and *People v. Konow* (2004) emphasize the importance of detailed trial court rulings when due process violations are alleged.

This Court is not being asked to write a novel — only to comply with **its obligation to ensure transparency where the Constitution is at stake**.

---

## III. THIS MOTION IS NOT “PREMATURE” — TRIAL IS SET FOR APRIL 9

The People suggest this motion is unnecessary — but as of this filing:

- More than **20 defense motions** remain pending;
- The Court has issued **no written orders** on Brady, Franks, or suppression claims;
- No record exists to explain the Court’s rationale, despite multiple filings requesting relief;
- Trial begins **April 9** — and Defendant is forced to proceed without knowing the legal basis for denial of key constitutional motions.

> *Mathews v. Eldridge* requires not just fairness — but the appearance of fairness and reviewability.

If the Court intends to deny any of the pending motions, the Defendant is entitled to a written basis for that denial.

---

## IV. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law for any ruling on the following categories of motions:
   - Brady violations;
   - Franks-related suppression;
   - CCP §995 jurisdictional challenges;
   - Sanctions under Penal Code §1054.5;
   - Judicial inquiry motions;
   - Any ruling on CCP §170.6 jurisdiction or disqualification;
2. Comply with CCP §632 where findings are statutorily or constitutionally required;
3. Ensure a full and complete appellate record.

---

## V. CONCLUSION

The People do not oppose this motion. The Court has discretion to issue findings. But where a record shows suppression, bias, and constitutional violations, **transparency is not optional — it is the floor of fairness.**

The appellate courts — and possibly federal habeas courts — will review what happens next. If the Court issues rulings without findings, it risks reversal or collateral consequence.

This motion should be granted as unopposed.

Defendant, *In Sui Juris*
