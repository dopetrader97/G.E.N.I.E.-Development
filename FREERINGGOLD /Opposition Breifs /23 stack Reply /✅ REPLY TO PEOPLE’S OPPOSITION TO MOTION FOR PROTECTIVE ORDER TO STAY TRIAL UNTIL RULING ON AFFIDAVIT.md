# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO STAY TRIAL UNTIL RULING ON AFFIDAVIT**  
**(Filed March 27, 2025 | Opposed by DA in Omnibus §II.U)**

---

### 🧠 Purpose of Your Motion:

This motion sought:

- A **protective order** to delay trial until the Court ruled on the admissibility and status of **Emmanuel Davis’s affidavit** and related witness testimony;
- Preservation of your **due process** rights;
- An assurance that you would not be forced to trial while Brady, Franks, and subpoena motions remained unresolved.

---

### 🔍 What the DA Said in Omnibus §II.U:

> “Defendant was given an opportunity to waive time for trial to provide the People, Defendant, and the Court with sufficient time to address all pending motions. Defendant refuses to waive time. Accordingly, in order to comply with Defendant’s speedy trial rights, the People object to any continuance or ‘stay’ without a proper time waiver.”

🟥 Translation: *If you don’t waive time, we’re forcing trial — even if we haven’t turned over all the evidence or ruled on your motions.*

That’s **structural due process denial**. And we’re about to show why.

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**

**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Protective Order to Stay Trial Until Ruling on Affidavit (Emmanuel Davis).

The DA does not dispute that:

- The affidavit is **on file**;
- A motion to admit it was **filed and served**;
- A subpoena for Davis was **filed and served**;
- And that the Court has not yet **ruled** on any of these matters.

Instead, the DA argues that because Defendant has not waived time under Penal Code §1382, the trial must proceed — even if multiple constitutional motions remain unruled.

That is not law. That is coercion. And it violates due process.

---

## II. REFUSAL TO WAIVE TIME IS NOT A FORFEITURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

The right to a speedy trial **does not cancel** the right to:

- Full discovery;
- Access to exculpatory witnesses;
- Evidentiary rulings;
- Judicial neutrality.

> *Mathews v. Eldridge*, *Brady*, *Kyles*, *Franks*, and *Pompa-Ortiz* all make clear: **A trial without fair process is a violation of constitutional law — not a compliance with statutory timing.*

The People cite **no authority** for the idea that refusal to waive time justifies denial of evidentiary rulings or admission of key affidavits.

---

## III. THE COURT HAS NOT RULED ON THE DAVIS AFFIDAVIT, SUBPOENA, OR MOTIONS TO COMPEL

As of this filing:

- The **Davis affidavit** remains unresolved;
- The **Motion to Submit Affidavit as Evidence** remains unruled;
- The **Motion to Subpoena Davis** remains unruled;
- The **Emergency Motion to Compel Witness Testimony** is unruled;
- The **Motion to Enforce Rule 8.54(c)** on the DA’s non-response to those motions is also unruled.

> Proceeding to trial under these circumstances would **violate fundamental due process**.

---

## IV. STAYING TRIAL TO SECURE A RULING ON AN AFFIDAVIT IS PROPER, NECESSARY, AND FAIR

Defendant has not asked to delay trial for tactical advantage — but to secure a ruling on:

- Whether a **key exculpatory witness affidavit** will be heard;
- Whether the Court will enforce the **subpoena** for that witness;
- Whether the Court will require the DA to comply with **Brady** and **discovery** rules.

That is not delay. That is the preservation of constitutional rights — and no defendant should be forced to choose between a fair trial and a speedy one.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Grant a **protective order** staying trial until the Court:
   - Rules on the Davis affidavit;
   - Rules on the Motion to Submit Affidavit;
   - Rules on the Davis subpoena;
   - Rules on the Emergency Motion to Compel;
2. Confirm that **refusal to waive time** does not justify skipping rulings on Brady and evidentiary motions;
3. Issue written findings under **CCP §632** to preserve the record for appeal.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The DA wants trial to proceed before the Court has ruled on:

- A sworn exculpatory affidavit;
- A valid subpoena;
- Multiple Brady and suppression motions.

That is not justice. That is procedural coercion.

This Court has the power — and the obligation — to stay proceedings until these motions are resolved.
