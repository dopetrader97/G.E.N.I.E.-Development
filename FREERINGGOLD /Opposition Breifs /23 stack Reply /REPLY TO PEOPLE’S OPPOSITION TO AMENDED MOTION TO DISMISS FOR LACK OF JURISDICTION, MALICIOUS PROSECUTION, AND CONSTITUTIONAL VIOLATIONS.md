## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 omnibus opposition to Defendant’s Amended Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, Malicious Prosecution, and Constitutional Violations. The opposition fails to meaningfully respond to the specific constitutional and procedural defects outlined in the motion.

This reply reasserts that:

- The complaint and information are **procedurally invalid**;
- The prosecution is **knowingly continuing** a case built on **fabricated probable cause**;
- The failure to correct the record after Brady disclosures and exculpatory affidavits is **malicious** under law;
- The DA’s opposition is conclusory and **waived under Rule 8.54(c)**.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION IS CONCLUSORY AND LEGALLY DEFICIENT

The DA states that:

> “Defendant fails to make a sufficient showing that the People have engaged in malicious prosecution, which the People strenuously deny.”

This is not a legal rebuttal. The People do not:

- Provide exhibits;
- Rebut the facts regarding exculpatory witnesses;
- Respond to the record regarding the **defective complaint**;
- Cite controlling case law, declarations, or court rules.

This is not opposition — it is **procedural default**. Per California Rule of Court **8.54(c)**, this Court may (and should) treat the People’s failure to oppose as **waiver** and grant the motion.

---

## III. THE COMPLAINT AND INFORMATION ARE PROCEDURALLY DEFECTIVE

The DA makes no attempt to rebut that:

- The original **felony complaint was unverified**, violating **Penal Code §806**;
- The subsequent **information failed to cure** the defect, violating **Penal Code §949**;
- The charging documents lack proper **signature and verification** required by statute.

These are not “technical” violations. Per *People v. Tannahill* and *People v. Hall*, a magistrate cannot proceed without jurisdiction created by a compliant charging instrument.

A structurally defective complaint invalidates all downstream proceedings, including:

- The preliminary hearing,
- The search warrant,
- And any derivative prosecution based on that filing.

---

## IV. THE CONTINUATION OF THIS CASE IS MALICIOUS AND SELECTIVE

The People also fail to respond to the core factual showing of **malicious prosecution**:

- They were informed by **Emmanuel Davis** that Defendant made no threats and was unarmed — yet **continued prosecution** anyway;
- They never included Davis’s statement in discovery, despite **listing him as a victim** in Counts 2 and 4;
- They dropped those counts quietly — **without disclosing Davis's exculpatory statement**;
- They excluded **Melissa Paradise**, who was present at the scene and saw no threat;
- They continued to build their case around a **single, disputed narrative**, while **suppressing and omitting every account that contradicted it**.

This is not simply misconduct. It is **willful continuation of a prosecution** that the People know is not supported by probable cause.

That satisfies the legal standard for **malicious prosecution** under *People v. Uhlemann*, *Brady v. Maryland*, and *Kyles v. Whitley*.

---

## V. THIS COURT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DISMISS FOR STRUCTURAL VIOLATIONS

The Court has the power — and the duty — to dismiss when:

- The complaint and information are facially defective;
- The prosecution proceeds in bad faith;
- The Defendant’s rights to due process, fair trial, and full discovery are systematically denied.

Dismissal is warranted under:

- **Penal Code §1385** – In the interest of justice;
- **Penal Code §1054.5** – As a sanction for discovery misconduct;
- **Brady/Giglio/Napue** – For suppression of material, favorable evidence;
- **Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court**, 27 Cal.3d 519 – For prejudicial pretrial irregularities;
- **Mathews v. Eldridge**, 424 U.S. 319 – For denial of a fair, balanced hearing process.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Dismiss the information for lack of jurisdiction and prosecutorial bad faith;
2. Issue a written finding that the complaint and information were procedurally defective;
3. Impose sanctions for malicious prosecution and systemic Brady violations;
4. Grant relief under Penal Code §1385, Penal Code §1054.5, and due process authority.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The People’s opposition is a non-response. They ignore the law. They ignore the facts. And they continue a prosecution based on omissions, not evidence.

The Court cannot legitimize a case built on a defective complaint, misleading affidavits, suppressed witnesses, and procedural shortcuts.

Dismissal is not discretionary — it is constitutionally required.
