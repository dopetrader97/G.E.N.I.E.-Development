# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE UNDER PENAL CODE § 1538.5**

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply addresses the People’s omnibus opposition (Section II.Q) to Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence under Penal Code § 1538.5. The DA’s response fails to address the motion’s core content, misstates the legal burden, and ignores the fatal defects in the warrant, the seizure, and the subsequent discovery process.

This motion is not about second-guessing law enforcement — it is about:

- **False or misleading warrant information**;
- **Omitted Brady witnesses**;
- **A firearm unlinked to the incident**;
- And **suppressed foundational evidence** that is still missing.

Under these conditions, suppression is not optional — it is constitutionally required.

---

## II. THE DA’S OPPOSITION IS A GENERIC, FACTLESS NON-RESPONSE

The People’s opposition relies on boilerplate law and fails to engage with the actual allegations:

- They argue a warrant makes the search presumptively valid;
- They cite *Leon* and claim “good faith” reliance;
- They claim Defendant failed to specify what should be suppressed;
- They make **no reference to**:
  - The **Franks omissions**,
  - The **delayed or incomplete discovery**,
  - The **lack of chain of custody** for the firearm,
  - The fact that the gun was recovered **weeks after** the alleged incident and **never linked to the charges**.

This is not a lawful opposition under *People v. Williams* or *Brady v. Maryland*. It is a procedural dodge.

---

## III. THE WARRANT AFFIDAVIT WAS MATERIALLY MISLEADING — A FRANKS HEARING IS REQUIRED

The search warrant affidavit by Detective Catherine Hall-Fein:

- **Omitted exculpatory statements** from key witnesses Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise;
- **Misled the magistrate** by relying solely on one-sided claims from the alleged victim;
- Never disclosed that **Davis refuted the firearm and threat allegations**, or that **Paradise was present and saw nothing**.

These omissions are not technical errors — they are **material violations** of the Fourth Amendment under *Franks v. Delaware* (1978) 438 U.S. 154.

> “Where an affiant omits known facts that would negate probable cause, and those omissions are intentional or reckless, the warrant is invalid.” — *Franks*, 438 U.S. at 171

Because the affidavit cannot survive without the omitted facts, the Court must order a **Franks hearing** and suppress the warrant’s fruits.

---

## IV. THE FIREARM IS UNAUTHENTICATED, UNCHAINED, AND INADMISSIBLE

The DA’s opposition never addresses the most basic point: **the firearm allegedly recovered is not legally tied to the charges**.

- It was found **on December 4, 2023** — nearly three weeks after the November 13 incident;
- There are **no chain of custody logs**, **no recovery photos**, and **no forensic linkage**;
- No evidence places that firearm in Defendant’s possession on the date of the alleged threat;
- No fingerprints, no ballistics, no video — nothing but narrative.

The firearm's admission violates:

- California Evidence Code §§ **1400–1402** (authentication requirement);
- *People v. Sanchez*, 63 Cal.4th 665 — "Evidence lacking proper foundation must be excluded";
- *Brady* and *Kyles* — material evidence must be timely disclosed for effective defense preparation.

---

## V. THE GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION DOES NOT APPLY — LEON CANNOT SHIELD FRAUD

The People cite *United States v. Leon* (1984) 468 U.S. 897 to argue that the officers acted in “good faith” reliance on the warrant. This is **factually and legally invalid** here.

> *Leon* applies only where the warrant is facially valid and the affiant **did not lie or recklessly omit facts.**

But here:

- The affidavit **excluded known exculpatory witness accounts**;
- The affiant **never disclosed that charges against Davis were dropped**;
- The affiant never disclosed the **existence of Davis’s exculpatory affidavit** or Paradise’s corroborating statement;
- The DA never explained the **weeks-long gap** between incident and recovery.

Under these facts, *Leon* does not apply. The magistrate was misled, and the officers cannot claim they acted on good-faith assumptions when they omitted critical information.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests the Court:

1. Grant a **Franks hearing** on the basis of the materially misleading affidavit;
2. Suppress the **firearm** and any derivative evidence;
3. Suppress any **statements**, **reports**, or **affidavits** stemming from the unlawful search;
4. Issue written findings under **CCP §632** and **Penal Code §1538.5(i)**;
5. Award any further relief the Court deems appropriate to safeguard due process.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

This is not a close call.

- The warrant was granted based on an affidavit full of holes;
- The firearm was discovered weeks later, with no forensic link to the crime;
- Key witnesses were hidden from the magistrate and the defense;
- And now the prosecution wants to treat this like a routine warrant case.

This is **not routine**. It is a case of **manufactured probable cause, Brady suppression, and foundational defects**. The Court must suppress the evidence and restore the integrity of these proceedings.
