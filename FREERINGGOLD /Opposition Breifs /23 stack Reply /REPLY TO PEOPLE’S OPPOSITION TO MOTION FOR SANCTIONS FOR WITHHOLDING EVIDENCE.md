**Dept.: 128**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s **Motion for Sanctions Against the Prosecution for Withholding Evidence**, filed February 14, 2025. The People responded with a boilerplate dismissal, labeling the motion “duplicative” of the Brady claim (Omnibus §II.N), and referring back to their equally deficient Section II.D.

This is not a **duplicative Brady motion**. This is a **statutory sanctions motion** under **Penal Code §1054.5(b)**, based on clear evidence of:

- Discovery violations;
- Suppressed exculpatory statements;
- Late disclosures days before trial;
- And a pattern of misconduct that materially impaired the defense.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION IS A WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

The People never address:

- The date evidence was due (per discovery orders);
- The volume of discovery withheld (1,300+ pages);
- The exculpatory content of suppressed statements;
- The timing of late disclosures;
- Or their failure to meet and confer as ordered by the Court.

Instead, they recycle generic language from their Brady section and call the motion “duplicative.” That is **not a legal opposition**. Under California Rule of Court **8.54(c)**, the failure to respond to a motion’s substance constitutes a **procedural waiver**.

---

## III. THIS MOTION SEEKS RELIEF UNDER PENAL CODE §1054.5(b) — NOT JUST DISMISSAL

Brady is about fairness. **Penal Code §1054.5** is about **accountability**.

> **§1054.5(b):**  
> “If the court finds that a party has not complied with this chapter, the court may make any order necessary to enforce compliance, including... the ordering of sanctions.”

This motion is based on violations of:

- **§1054.1(a), (b), and (c)** – failure to disclose statements, documents, and exculpatory material;
- **§1054.7** – failure to disclose within a reasonable time before trial;
- **§1054.5(b)** – failure to meet discovery obligations **after repeated notice and opportunity to cure**.

Sanctions may include:

- **Exclusion of evidence**;
- **Fines**;
- **Striking of witness testimony**;
- And/or a **judicial finding of misconduct**.

---

## IV. THE RECORD ESTABLISHES INTENTIONAL DISCOVERY MISCONDUCT

The following facts remain uncontested:

- The defense received only **243 pages** of discovery over 50 days;
- More than **1,300 additional pages** were withheld until **April 2–3, 2025**, just days before trial;
- The DA **withheld material witness accounts**, including:
  - Emmanuel Davis – whose affidavit refutes two charges;
  - Melissa Paradise – present at the scene but omitted from all police reports;
- The DA **violated court orders** to meet and confer regarding discovery (see March 24 transcript);
- The DA **failed to respond** when notified of these delays via email, motions, and court filings.

This is **not mere delay**. It is a **pattern of suppression**.

---

## V. PREJUDICE TO DEFENDANT IS SEVERE

- Defendant was forced to respond to omnibus opposition **without the full evidence**;
- Defendant’s Brady, Franks, and suppression motions were prepared **under incomplete facts**;
- The trial is set for **April 9, 2025**, and the defense has not had reasonable time to process **1,300+ late pages** of material;
- Witnesses (e.g. Davis) were excluded from all police filings, despite being **named victims** or **on-site observers**.

The court cannot allow the DA to violate constitutional and statutory obligations — then avoid sanctions by calling it “duplication.”

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Impose sanctions** on the prosecution pursuant to **Penal Code §1054.5(b)**;
2. **Strike the firearm evidence** and associated testimony for failure to timely disclose custody logs and authentication;
3. **Preclude testimony** from any witness whose discovery was withheld past the statutory deadline;
4. **Order monetary or evidentiary sanctions** appropriate to the prejudice suffered;
5. **Issue written findings** under CCP §632 to preserve this issue for appeal.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The prosecution violated the rules. Not once. Repeatedly.

They withheld core evidence. They ignored witness statements. They defied deadlines. Then they called it “duplicative.”

This Court must not let the DA benefit from its own misconduct. Sanctions are not a request for vengeance — they are a demand for justice.
