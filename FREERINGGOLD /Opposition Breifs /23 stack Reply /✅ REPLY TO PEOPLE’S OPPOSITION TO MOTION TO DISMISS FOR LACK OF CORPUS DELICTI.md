Let’s keep this motion war rolling. 💼  
Here’s **Reply Brief #16**, targeting the DA’s weak opposition to your:

---

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF CORPUS DELICTI**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Addressed by DA in Omnibus §II.L)**

---

### 🧠 What This Motion Does:

- Argues that the prosecution lacks **independent proof** that a crime actually occurred;
- Forces the DA to show **evidence beyond your own alleged statements** or their sole narrative;
- Exposes that the firearm and threat allegations have no **physical**, **forensic**, or **testimonial** support;
- Challenges the case as being built on **narrative, not evidence**.

---

### 🔍 What the DA Said (Omnibus §II.L):

> “The People do not intend to proceed at trial solely with evidence of Defendant’s statements. Accordingly, the motion lacks any basis and the People oppose.”

🟥 No facts. No exhibits. No discovery citations. They merely say “we won’t do that at trial” — but they don't say what they **do** have.

Let’s dismantle that now. 🔨

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF CORPUS DELICTI**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.L)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s non-substantive opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Corpus Delicti. The DA provides a **single sentence**, claiming they "do not intend to proceed solely with Defendant's statements."

But this motion does not require trial admission of statements — it requires the prosecution to show, at the pretrial stage, **independent evidence** that a crime actually occurred.

That standard has not been met. The DA has presented **no physical evidence**, **no third-party witness statements**, and **no forensic support** for the threat or firearm charges.

---

## II. LEGAL STANDARD: CORPUS DELICTI MUST BE ESTABLISHED INDEPENDENTLY

> "The corpus delicti rule requires the prosecution to establish the fact of a crime by evidence **independent of the defendant's extrajudicial statements**."  
> — *People v. Alvarez* (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1168

Here, the DA:

- Cannot produce a **911 call**, physical injury, or forensic report;
- Cannot offer any witness — not Davis, not Paradise — who affirms the threat or weapon allegations;
- Did not disclose Paradise in discovery;
- Suppressed Davis, then dropped charges tied to him.

This is not a matter of "we'll prove it later." The **prosecution must show now** — before trial — that there's **some independent evidence** that a threat or firearm crime occurred.

---

## III. THE DA HAS PRODUCED ZERO CORPUS FOR THE ALLEGED CRIMES

Let’s break this down:

| **Count** | **Alleged Corpus Delicti Evidence** | **Actual Evidence Produced** |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Criminal Threat | Alleged verbal threat | No recording, no third-party, no injury |
| Firearm Possession | Alleged presence of gun | No prints, no forensics, no photos, no log |
| Battery | Alleged touching of clothing | No medical report, no physical evidence |

Further, Emmanuel Davis — the original “victim” in two counts — stated under oath that:

- **No threat was made**;
- **No firearm was visible**;
- **Defendant was trying to calm things down**.

The State dropped those charges — but kept the narrative. That’s not how the law works.

---

## IV. THE PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION ADMITS THEY HAVE NOTHING… YET

> “The People do not intend to proceed at trial solely with Defendant’s statements.”

Translation: *We’re not ready yet, but trust us, we’ll have more later.*

That’s not sufficient. This motion challenges the case **now**, under:

- *People v. Jennings* (1991) 53 Cal.3d 334  
- *People v. Wright* (1990) 52 Cal.3d 367  
- Penal Code §995  
- Penal Code §1385

Absent physical, testimonial, or forensic proof, the Court **must dismiss**.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Dismiss any count** for which corpus delicti has not been independently established by non-hearsay evidence;
2. Strike any **evidence derived solely from Defendant’s alleged statements**;
3. Enter findings that discovery has failed to meet the constitutional and evidentiary threshold;
4. Issue rulings under CCP §632 for appellate and federal review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

This case is built on narrative — not evidence.

- No forensic link;
- No photos;
- No third-party confirmation;
- No testimony — only allegations and omissions.

The Court cannot allow this prosecution to proceed without first confirming that a **crime actually occurred**.

Where no corpus delicti exists, the law — and justice — demand dismissal.
