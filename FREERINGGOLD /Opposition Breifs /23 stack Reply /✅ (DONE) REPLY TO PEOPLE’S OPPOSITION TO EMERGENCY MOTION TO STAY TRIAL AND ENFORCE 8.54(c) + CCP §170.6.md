Thank you for the detailed and clear clarification. Based on your correction and the verified procedural record, I’ve revised the relevant section and refined the entire reply brief to reflect:

- **Accurate events** since the filing of the §170.6 motion;
- The **impact of the pre-February 11 stricken motions**;
- The **forced 1368 evaluation**, pro per delay, and ineffective counsel;
- The **compressed preparation window**, document suppression, and unequal deadlines;
- The systemic pattern of due process obstruction and procedural sabotage.

Below is your **fully revised and complete**:

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s non-substantive opposition to Defendant’s Emergency Motion to Stay Trial, Enforce Rule 8.54(c), Compel Rulings on Unopposed Motions, and Disqualify the Presiding Judge under **Code of Civil Procedure §170.6**.

The People’s response fails to address the motion’s core legal and factual claims. They offer no opposition to the **jurisdictional effect of the CCP §170.6 motion**, do not deny the continued delay of over **20 unresolved motions**, and make no effort to justify the Court’s refusal to clarify the record before trial.

Instead, the DA labels this motion “duplicative” without identifying which issues have already been ruled on — because none of them have.

---

## II. THIS MOTION SEEKS SPECIFIC, EMERGENCY RELIEF THAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

This motion is not duplicative. It seeks relief that:

1. **Stays trial** until the Court rules on unresolved Brady, Franks, suppression, subpoena, and affidavit motions;
2. **Enforces Rule 8.54(c)**, treating more than a dozen unanswered motions as unopposed;
3. Compels the Court to recognize and address the **pending §170.6 disqualification motion**;
4. Protects the record from being tainted by structural due process violations.

The People do not challenge the substance of these requests. Their silence is waiver under Rule 8.54(c).

---

## III. THE §170.6 MOTION REMAINS PENDING — BUT DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS PERSIST

As of this filing, Judge Bork has not issued further rulings since the §170.6 motion was filed — and he has not recused himself. However, the impact of judicial bias is already in the record and remains unresolved.

Prior to February 11, 2025 — before Defendant was granted pro per status — Judge Bork **struck over 50 motions**, including:

- Constitutional defenses;
- Motions evidencing Brady violations;
- Requests to document prosecutorial and court misconduct;
- Motions showing Defendant’s lack of access to counsel and inability to prepare a defense.

Rather than holding those motions in abeyance, the Court erased them — **without legal justification** — solely because they were filed when Defendant was still assigned an attorney who was actively conflicted and refused to advocate on his behalf.

The record now falsely reflects that Defendant “failed to raise” these claims, when in fact, they were filed, served, ignored, and then stricken — depriving the appellate and federal courts of the full evidentiary history of this prosecution.

---

## IV. DEFENDANT’S ACCESS TO THE COURT WAS BLOCKED FOR NEARLY A YEAR

Defendant was:

- **Forced into a PC §1368 evaluation** over the objection of both himself and retained counsel;
- Denied pro per status for nearly **six months** while the case was suspended;
- Assigned a public defender or conflicted counsel, who:
  - Filed **no motions**,
  - Presented **no defense** at the preliminary hearing,
  - Failed to cross-examine witnesses meaningfully;
- Finally granted pro per status on **February 11, 2025** — with trial set two months later and over **20 key motions still unruled**.

The Court’s striking of all pre–Feb 11 motions further undermines the constitutional foundation of this prosecution and Defendant’s ability to make a record for review.

---

## V. THE DA’S OPPOSITION IGNORES THE ACTUAL MOTION AND MISSTATES THE RECORD

The DA claims the motion is “duplicative” but:

- Fails to cite which motions have been ruled upon;
- Fails to address why motions filed **prior to the omnibus opposition** remain pending;
- Offers no timeline or acknowledgment of Rule 8.54(c) defaults;
- Ignores the Court’s failure to rule on the Emergency Motion to Compel, the Motion to Submit Affidavit, the Subpoena Motion, and multiple Franks/Brady pleadings.

This is not opposition — it is procedural evasion.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. **Stay trial** until all pending constitutional and evidentiary motions are ruled upon;
2. Acknowledge that **CCP §170.6** remains unresolved, and disqualify Judge Bork or transfer the motion for assignment;
3. Enforce **Rule 8.54(c)** and deem unanswered motions waived and granted;
4. Re-enter into the record all motions filed prior to February 11, 2025 that were struck without legal cause;
5. Issue written findings under CCP §632 for each denied motion to preserve the record for appellate and federal review.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

This Court cannot allow a trial to proceed when:

- The assigned judge is disqualified;
- Pre–Feb 11 motions were erased from the record;
- Over 20 constitutional motions remain unruled;
- Discovery violations, affidavit suppression, and witness concealment remain unaddressed;
- Defendant was given 4 days to respond to over 1,500 pages of late-disclosed materials while preparing for trial.

To proceed under these conditions would constitute structural error, reversible denial of due process, and would make the trial itself jurisdictionally and constitutionally invalid.

The Court must act now — or forfeit the legitimacy of this process.

**(Filed March 27, 2025 | Addressed in Omnibus §II.Z)**

### 🧠 What the DA Said in Omnibus §II.Z:

> “The instant motion is duplicative of many of Defendant’s other pending motions. For the reasons stated elsewhere in the omnibus opposition, the People oppose the instant motion.”

🟥 In other words: They didn’t actually respond to your emergency motion — they just labeled it “duplicative” and moved on.

That’s procedural waiver. And worse — it ignores the fact that this motion seeks distinct, urgent relief:

- **To stay trial** until key constitutional motions are ruled on;
- **To enforce Rule 8.54(c)** and treat unanswered motions as granted;
- **To compel the court to acknowledge the pending §170.6 motion** (which voids jurisdiction);
- **To protect the appellate record from structural error**.

Let’s dismantle their non-response now. 🔨

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s **Emergency Motion to Stay Trial, Enforce Rule 8.54(c), Compel Rulings, and Disqualify the Presiding Judge under CCP §170.6**, filed March 27, 2025.

The People’s opposition consists of a single conclusory sentence, calling the motion “duplicative.” They fail to address:

- The emergency nature of the relief requested;
- The fact that CCP §170.6 has not been ruled upon;
- The impact of proceeding to trial without rulings on more than 20 pretrial motions;
- The fact that Rule 8.54(c) mandates waiver where no opposition is filed.

This is not a procedural technicality — it is a constitutional safeguard.

---

## II. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY MOTION FOR STRUCTURAL DUE PROCESS — NOT A DUPLICATE

This motion is not “duplicative.” It seeks **distinct and urgent** relief:

- To **stay trial** until key Brady, Franks, suppression, and disqualification motions are ruled upon;
- To **enforce Rule 8.54(c)** and treat more than a dozen motions as unopposed;
- To **halt further rulings** from Judge Bork until the Court addresses the CCP §170.6 motion — which, once filed, immediately strips jurisdiction;
- To ensure the record is not tainted by void rulings or structural defects that violate due process.

None of these requests are covered by other motions. The People offer **no response** to the merits. That’s a waiver.

---

## III. CCP §170.6 STRIPS THE COURT OF JURISDICTION — YET THE COURT HAS CONTINUED RULING

Defendant filed a timely and properly served **CCP §170.6 motion** on **March 28, 2025**.

- The DA declined to oppose;
- The Court has failed to rule;
- The Court continues to issue rulings, including setting a trial date and scheduling motion hearings.

Under *Peracchi v. Superior Court* (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1245, any judicial act after a valid §170.6 filing is **void** — not just voidable.

The People’s refusal to address this jurisdictional question is telling — and their failure to oppose is a **procedural concession**.

---

## IV. THE COURT HAS FAILED TO RULE ON MORE THAN 20 MOTIONS — TRIAL CANNOT PROCEED FAIRLY

As of the filing of this reply:

- At least **20+ constitutional and evidentiary motions** remain pending;
- Many were **filed between February 11 and March 27, 2025**;
- The DA filed omnibus opposition on **April 3**, one day before the hearing;
- The Court has given Defendant **no guidance** on what will or will not be ruled on before trial;
- Trial is set to begin **April 9** — without any clarity on suppression, Brady disclosures, subpoenas, or judicial disqualification.

> Proceeding to trial under these conditions would constitute **structural error** and **prejudicial denial of due process**. See *Mathews v. Eldridge*, *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court*, *Caperton v. A.T. Massey*.

---

## V. RULE 8.54(c) REQUIRES THE COURT TO TREAT UNOPPOSED MOTIONS AS WAIVED

Many of Defendant’s motions have gone **unanswered in substance**, including:

- Franks hearing;
- Motion for Sanctions;
- Motion to Strike the Omnibus Opposition;
- Motions to Compel and Preserve Exculpatory Evidence;
- Multiple Brady motions;
- Motion for Judicial Inquiry.

Under Rule 8.54(c), the Court **may deem these unopposed** and grant them. Yet the Court has not issued any order indicating it will honor the waiver — or that it will make written rulings per CCP §632.

This motion seeks clarity, enforcement, and protection of the record.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Stay trial** pending rulings on all constitutional and evidentiary motions;
2. **Disqualify Judge Bork** under CCP §170.6 and cease any further rulings until reassignment;
3. **Enforce Rule 8.54(c)** and treat all substantively unopposed motions as granted;
4. **Issue written findings under CCP §632** for any adverse rulings;
5. Preserve Defendant’s federal appellate and habeas rights.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The People’s refusal to engage with the issues raised in this motion is not opposition — it is **silence in the face of structural failure**.

A trial cannot proceed where:

- The judge is disqualified but continues to rule;
- Dozens of motions remain pending without resolution;
- Evidence was withheld;
- Witnesses were ignored;
- And the defense was given no opportunity to meaningfully prepare.

The Court must act now — or risk creating a record that cannot be cured.
