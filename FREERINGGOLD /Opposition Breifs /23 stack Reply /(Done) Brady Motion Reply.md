### ‚úÖ **REPLY TO PEOPLE‚ÄôS OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS FOR PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT (BRADY VIOLATION)**  
**(In Response to Omnibus Opposition Filed April 3, 2025)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Date: April 8, 2025**

---

**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply addresses the People‚Äôs April 3, 2025 **omnibus opposition** to Defendant‚Äôs Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct (Brady Violation). The People‚Äôs opposition is:

- **Procedurally defective** under Rule 8.54(c),  
- **Constitutionally insufficient** under *Brady*, *Giglio*, and Penal Code ¬ß 1054.1, and  
- **Strategically evasive**, constituting a waiver of opposition by silence and generalization.

The DA fails to address the core evidence, fails to rebut the suppressed witness material, and instead hides behind vague, grouped, and duplicative language. This constitutes **non-opposition in substance and in law**.

---

## II. DA‚ÄôS OMNIBUS FILING IS A NON-RESPONSE TO THIS MOTION

The People did **not oppose this motion on its individual merits**. Instead, they:

- Labeled the motion as ‚Äúattached‚Äù or ‚Äúduplicative‚Äù (Omnibus Opposition, ¬ßII.D),  
- Did not cite or challenge the **actual Brady material at issue**, and  
- Relied entirely on procedural summaries and blanket denials.

Per California Rule of Court **8.54(c)**:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

The People‚Äôs **April 3 filing**, served 51 days after the motion and one day before the hearing, fails to respond meaningfully to this motion. It is **procedurally untimely**, substantively vacant, and must be treated as **waived**.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATION REMAINS UNREBUTTED

The DA did not contest the **core Brady evidence**:

1. **Emmanuel Davis** ‚Äì A named ‚Äúvictim‚Äù in Counts 2 and 4 (later dropped), whose **sworn affidavit** states he saw **no gun**, heard **no threat**, and witnessed the Defendant trying to **de-escalate**.  
   - He was never interviewed, never mentioned in discovery, and omitted entirely from reports.

2. **Melissa Paradise** ‚Äì Named in initial police reports by the alleged victim but never contacted or disclosed. She is willing to testify that:
   - She **saw no weapon**, **heard no threat**, and was **never in fear**.
   - Her identity and account were **withheld from discovery** and **excluded** from both redacted and unredacted police reports.

The DA‚Äôs only response? A single boilerplate sentence:

> ‚ÄúThe instant motion‚Ä¶ fails to make any particular assertions or provide any evidence of prosecutorial misconduct.‚Äù (Omnibus Opposition, ¬ßII.D)

Yet the People **do not dispute**:
- The **existence** of these statements,
- The **late disclosure** (April 2‚Äì3),
- The **failure to turn them over** before the opposition deadline,
- Or the **prejudicial impact** of this suppression.

Thus, the DA has procedurally **and constitutionally defaulted** under *Brady v. Maryland*, *Giglio v. United States*, and *Kyles v. Whitley*.

---

## IV. THE DAVIS AFFIDAVIT WAS FILED, SERVED, AND IGNORED ‚Äî NOT DISCLOSED

The People‚Äôs opposition fails to acknowledge one of the most glaring examples of **prosecutorial suppression** in this case: their knowledge of and refusal to disclose or respond to **Emmanuel Davis‚Äôs exculpatory account**.

- Mr. Davis was listed as a **named victim in Counts 2 and 4**, and was central to the State's early theory of the case.
- After the restraining order was lifted and the DA dropped the charges related to Davis, he provided Defendant with a **sworn affidavit** stating:
  - He saw **no gun**;
  - He heard **no threats**;
  - He believed the Defendant was **de-escalating** the situation.

The prosecution was aware of Davis‚Äôs account early on but omitted it from every police report, affidavit, and discovery packet.

### Immediately upon receiving pro per status:

- On **February 14, 2025**, just three days after being granted *sui juris* status, Defendant filed a conformed **Motion to Subpoena Witness Emmanuel Davis** for live testimony.
- On **March 7, 2025**, Defendant issued and served a judicially conformed **SUBP-002 subpoena**, with an evidentiary attachment outlining Davis‚Äôs exculpatory value.
- On **March 24, 2025**, Defendant filed and served a **Motion to Submit the Affidavit into Evidence**.
- On **March 27, 2025**, Defendant filed a **court-stamped Emergency Motion to Compel Testimony and Rulings**, again urging the Court to act on the suppressed witness.

The People never responded to any of these filings. They did not move to quash the subpoena. They did not dispute the content of the affidavit. They did not claim Davis was unavailable. They simply **ignored it all.**

> This is not procedural delay. This is **deliberate suppression** of material, favorable, and independently corroborated Brady evidence.

## V. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION: DENIAL OF INDIVIDUALIZED RESPONSE

By lumping this motion into a **blanket omnibus opposition**, the People:

- Denied Defendant the right to a **meaningful hearing** under *Mathews v. Eldridge*,  
- Obscured the constitutional importance of each claim, and  
- Violated Defendant‚Äôs **due process right to an individualized ruling**.

Grouping motions together may be administratively convenient, but when the **core issue is prosecutorial suppression of material exculpatory evidence**, general denial is **not acceptable**.

This approach also deprives the defense of the ability to meaningfully reply ‚Äî and the court of a record on which to fairly adjudicate.

---

## VI. FRANKS HEARING REQUIRED ‚Äì PEOPLE DID NOT CONTEST THE OMISSIONS

This Brady violation also crosses the **Franks threshold**:

- The warrant affidavit omitted **known witnesses** (Davis and Paradise),
- Their testimony **directly contradicts** the basis for probable cause,
- The DA **did not rebut** these omissions or challenge materiality.

Under *Franks v. Delaware* and *People v. Theodor*, where a motion shows **omitted material facts that affect probable cause**, and the DA fails to rebut or justify, a **Franks hearing is mandatory**.

---

## VII. CCP ¬ß170.6 STRIPS THE COURT OF JURISDICTION

On March 28, 2025, Defendant filed a **timely motion to disqualify Judge Bork** under **Code of Civil Procedure ¬ß 170.6**.

- The People **declined to oppose** (Omnibus Opposition, ¬ßII.V), constituting **procedural consent**.
- Once filed and unchallenged, **jurisdiction was lost**.
- Any ruling by Judge Bork **after March 28** is **void** under *Peracchi v. Superior Court*, 30 Cal.4th 1245.

Thus, this reply brief also serves to **preserve the jurisdictional objection** to any ruling issued by this court on April 8 or at trial.

---

## VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

Based on the foregoing, Defendant respectfully requests the Court:

1. **Strike or disregard** the DA‚Äôs opposition as to this motion under Rule 8.54(c);  
2. **Treat the Brady motion as unopposed**;  
3. **Hold a Franks hearing** regarding the omitted Davis and Paradise statements;  
4. **Dismiss** the charges, or in the alternative, **suppress** all tainted evidence;  
5. **Issue written findings of fact and law** under CCP ¬ß632 for appellate preservation;  
6. **Impose sanctions** under Penal Code ¬ß¬ß1054.1‚Äì1054.5 for the intentional suppression of exculpatory material.

---

## IX. CONCLUSION

The People‚Äôs failure to rebut the Brady motion is **not just procedural waiver** ‚Äî it is a **due process breach** and a **constitutional violation**. This Court cannot overlook the suppression of key exculpatory evidence, nor can it legitimize an omnibus opposition that denies the Defendant individualized justice.

The time for vague denial is over. The record is clear. Relief is required.
