# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO EMERGENCY MOTION TO STAY TRIAL, ENFORCE SUMMARY RULING UNDER RULE 8.54(c), COMPEL RULINGS ON UNOPPOSED MOTIONS, AND DISQUALIFY JUDGE UNDER CCP §170.6**  
**(Filed March 27, 2025 | Addressed in Omnibus §II.Z)**

### 🧠 What the DA Said in Omnibus §II.Z:

> “The instant motion is duplicative of many of Defendant’s other pending motions. For the reasons stated elsewhere in the omnibus opposition, the People oppose the instant motion.”

🟥 In other words: They didn’t actually respond to your emergency motion — they just labeled it “duplicative” and moved on.

That’s procedural waiver. And worse — it ignores the fact that this motion seeks distinct, urgent relief:

- **To stay trial** until key constitutional motions are ruled on;
- **To enforce Rule 8.54(c)** and treat unanswered motions as granted;
- **To compel the court to acknowledge the pending §170.6 motion** (which voids jurisdiction);
- **To protect the appellate record from structural error**.

Let’s dismantle their non-response now. 🔨

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s **Emergency Motion to Stay Trial, Enforce Rule 8.54(c), Compel Rulings, and Disqualify the Presiding Judge under CCP §170.6**, filed March 27, 2025.

The People’s opposition consists of a single conclusory sentence, calling the motion “duplicative.” They fail to address:

- The emergency nature of the relief requested;
- The fact that CCP §170.6 has not been ruled upon;
- The impact of proceeding to trial without rulings on more than 20 pretrial motions;
- The fact that Rule 8.54(c) mandates waiver where no opposition is filed.

This is not a procedural technicality — it is a constitutional safeguard.

---

## II. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY MOTION FOR STRUCTURAL DUE PROCESS — NOT A DUPLICATE

This motion is not “duplicative.” It seeks **distinct and urgent** relief:

- To **stay trial** until key Brady, Franks, suppression, and disqualification motions are ruled upon;
- To **enforce Rule 8.54(c)** and treat more than a dozen motions as unopposed;
- To **halt further rulings** from Judge Bork until the Court addresses the CCP §170.6 motion — which, once filed, immediately strips jurisdiction;
- To ensure the record is not tainted by void rulings or structural defects that violate due process.

None of these requests are covered by other motions. The People offer **no response** to the merits. That’s a waiver.

---

## III. CCP §170.6 STRIPS THE COURT OF JURISDICTION — YET THE COURT HAS CONTINUED RULING

Defendant filed a timely and properly served **CCP §170.6 motion** on **March 28, 2025**.

- The DA declined to oppose;
- The Court has failed to rule;
- The Court continues to issue rulings, including setting a trial date and scheduling motion hearings.

Under *Peracchi v. Superior Court* (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1245, any judicial act after a valid §170.6 filing is **void** — not just voidable.

The People’s refusal to address this jurisdictional question is telling — and their failure to oppose is a **procedural concession**.

---

## IV. THE COURT HAS FAILED TO RULE ON MORE THAN 20 MOTIONS — TRIAL CANNOT PROCEED FAIRLY

As of the filing of this reply:

- At least **20+ constitutional and evidentiary motions** remain pending;
- Many were **filed between February 11 and March 27, 2025**;
- The DA filed omnibus opposition on **April 3**, one day before the hearing;
- The Court has given Defendant **no guidance** on what will or will not be ruled on before trial;
- Trial is set to begin **April 9** — without any clarity on suppression, Brady disclosures, subpoenas, or judicial disqualification.

> Proceeding to trial under these conditions would constitute **structural error** and **prejudicial denial of due process**. See *Mathews v. Eldridge*, *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court*, *Caperton v. A.T. Massey*.

---

## V. RULE 8.54(c) REQUIRES THE COURT TO TREAT UNOPPOSED MOTIONS AS WAIVED

Many of Defendant’s motions have gone **unanswered in substance**, including:

- Franks hearing;
- Motion for Sanctions;
- Motion to Strike the Omnibus Opposition;
- Motions to Compel and Preserve Exculpatory Evidence;
- Multiple Brady motions;
- Motion for Judicial Inquiry.

Under Rule 8.54(c), the Court **may deem these unopposed** and grant them. Yet the Court has not issued any order indicating it will honor the waiver — or that it will make written rulings per CCP §632.

This motion seeks clarity, enforcement, and protection of the record.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Stay trial** pending rulings on all constitutional and evidentiary motions;
2. **Disqualify Judge Bork** under CCP §170.6 and cease any further rulings until reassignment;
3. **Enforce Rule 8.54(c)** and treat all substantively unopposed motions as granted;
4. **Issue written findings under CCP §632** for any adverse rulings;
5. Preserve Defendant’s federal appellate and habeas rights.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The People’s refusal to engage with the issues raised in this motion is not opposition — it is **silence in the face of structural failure**.

A trial cannot proceed where:

- The judge is disqualified but continues to rule;
- Dozens of motions remain pending without resolution;
- Evidence was withheld;
- Witnesses were ignored;
- And the defense was given no opportunity to meaningfully prepare.

The Court must act now — or risk creating a record that cannot be cured.

**Dated:** April 4, 2025  
**Respectfully submitted,**

**“Without Prejudice”**  
**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
Defendant, *In Sui Juris*
