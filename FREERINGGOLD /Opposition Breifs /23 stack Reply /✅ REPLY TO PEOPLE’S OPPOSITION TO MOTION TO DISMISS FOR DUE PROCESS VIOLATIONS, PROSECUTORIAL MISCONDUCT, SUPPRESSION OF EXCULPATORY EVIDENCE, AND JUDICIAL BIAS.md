**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Due Process Violations, Prosecutorial Misconduct, Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence, and Judicial Bias.

The People responded to this comprehensive motion with a single line:

> “The instant motion appears to be a repackaging of arguments raised in Defendant’s dozens of other pending motions... The People have addressed Defendant’s arguments elsewhere in the instant omnibus opposition, and decline to opine on Defendant’s motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6.” (Omnibus §II.V)

This is not a substantive legal opposition — it is an attempt to **evade responsibility for systemic misconduct**.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE HAVE WAIVED OPPOSITION UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

The motion raised specific, independently reviewable claims, including:

- Systemic **Brady violations**;
- Repeated **discovery suppression** in violation of **Penal Code §1054.1**;
- **Judicial bias** stemming from:
  - Unequal timelines,
  - Striking of defense motions,
  - Failure to rule on material issues;
- Late discovery dumps totaling **1,300+ pages**, delivered **after the opposition deadline**.

The People’s failure to respond to these allegations constitutes a waiver under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**. Their vague reference to “repackaging” is not a valid response under state or federal due process standards.

---

## III. THIS MOTION STANDS ALONE — IT IS NOT DUPLICATIVE

This motion is not a repeat of other filings. It focuses on:

1. **Cumulative due process violations**;
2. The **pattern of prosecutorial misconduct** spanning from charging to pretrial;
3. **Judicial favoritism** that undermined neutral process — including:
   - Allowing the DA 51 days to respond;
   - Giving Defendant only 4 days to reply;
   - Setting motion hearings **one day before trial**;
   - Failing to rule on more than 20 defense motions, many of which relate to Brady and suppression.

Each of these actions has created **structural prejudice**.

---

## IV. DUE PROCESS HAS BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED

This Court must consider the cumulative effect of:

- The DA’s **refusal to turn over Davis and Paradise witness statements**;
- The **failure to disclose surveillance, chain-of-custody, and photo logs**;
- The **suppression of over 1,300 pages of discovery** until the eve of trial;
- The **failure to rule on Franks, Brady, and suppression motions** filed months ago;
- The DA’s **failure to meet and confer** as ordered on March 24, 2025;
- The refusal to acknowledge the **CCP §170.6 motion**, which remains pending and unruled.

This is not a single mistake — it is a **pattern of procedural and constitutional violations**.

> The Supreme Court has held in *Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.* and *Mathews v. Eldridge* that due process requires more than the appearance of fairness — it requires meaningful opportunity to be heard by a neutral arbiter.

That has not occurred here.

---

## V. JUDICIAL BIAS HAS INFECTED THESE PROCEEDINGS

This motion also raised the ongoing **structural bias and procedural favoritism** of this Court, including:

- Denial of Defendant’s right to **equal time to prepare**;
- The **striking of over 50 pro per motions** without review;
- The Court’s refusal to rule on the **pending §170.6 motion**, which strips jurisdiction under *Peracchi v. Superior Court*.

These facts remain unrebutted. The People “decline to opine.” That’s not a defense — it’s a default.

---

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant dismissal** of all charges based on structural due process violations;
2. Enter a finding of **prosecutorial misconduct** based on withheld evidence and Brady violations;
3. Order that **no further rulings may be issued by Judge Bork** under CCP §170.6;
4. Issue **written findings of fact and law** under CCP §632;
5. Preserve the record for federal review under 28 U.S.C. §2254.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The prosecution has failed to respond. The Court has failed to rule. The process has failed to protect due process.

This is a structurally broken case — infected by judicial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, and suppression of material evidence. Dismissal is the only adequate remedy.
