Excellent. With your original **Emergency Motion to Compel Evidentiary Rulings, Preserve Exculpatory Material, and Compel Witness Testimony**, the **Declaration in Support**, and your **Preemptive Objection to Late Affidavit Opposition** reviewed — it’s clear the DA offered no substantive rebuttal in their omnibus opposition. They ignored:

- The materiality of the affidavit and evidence;
- Their 41+ day procedural default under Rule 8.54(c);
- The 51-day response gap vs. 4-day prep window;
- The suppression of Brady material and denied rulings on over 20 pending motions.

Below is your fully revised, non-redundant, and appellate-ready:

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s Emergency Motion to Compel Evidentiary Rulings, Preserve Exculpatory Material, and Compel Witness Testimony.

The People’s response is conclusory. They allege the motion is “repackaged” and fail to address:

- The procedural defaults under California Rule of Court 8.54(c);
- The Court’s refusal to rule on more than 20 pending motions;
- The suppression of Brady materials;
- The ignored subpoena for Emmanuel Davis;
- The 51-day delay allowed to the People versus 4 days given to Defendant.

This is not repackaged — it is emergency relief sought to prevent **trial by ambush** and protect the right to present a constitutionally adequate defense.

---

## II. THE DA FAILED TO REBUT THE SPECIFIC BASIS FOR THIS MOTION

Defendant’s motion (and verified declaration) laid out:

1. That the **Sworn Affidavit of Emmanuel Davis** was served, unopposed, and remains unruled;
2. That over **Several Exhibits** all Exculpatory in nature were filed under a Motion to Introduce New Evidence, with no ruling on admissibility;
3. That Davis was properly subpoenaed, but the DA never moved to quash, produce, or respond;
4. That more than **1,300 pages of discovery** were produced after the 10-day deadline for opposition and too close to trial to prepare.

The People did not:

- Dispute the facts in Defendant’s declaration;
- Explain their silence under Rule 8.54(c);
- Argue admissibility of the evidence or provide counter-declarations;
- Request clarification, continuance, or hearing.

Their failure to engage is waiver under Rule 8.54(c), and this Court must enforce it.

---

## III. THE FAILURE TO RULE HAS PREVENTED DEFENDANT FROM STRUCTURING A DEFENSE

As of this filing:

- The Court has refused to rule on the Davis affidavit;
- The Motion to Submit Affidavit remains unruled;
- The Motion to Subpoena Davis has not been acknowledged;
- The Emergency Motion to Compel, filed March 27, remains pending;
- Trial is scheduled for April 9, 2025 — yet admissibility of key exculpatory materials is still unknown.

This violates due process under:

- *Crane v. Kentucky* (1986) 476 U.S. 683 — right to present a defense;
- *Goldberg v. Kelly* (1970) 397 U.S. 254 — right to evidentiary hearing before deprivation;
- *Zinermon v. Burch* (1990) 494 U.S. 113 — arbitrary procedure constitutes deprivation.

This Court has given the DA 51 days to respond, while giving Defendant only 4 days to prepare for trial. That is procedural sabotage.

---

## IV. THE BRADY VIOLATIONS REMAIN UNADDRESSED

This motion sought confirmation that:

- The Davis affidavit would be preserved for trial and appellate review;
- The subpoena for Davis would be enforced;
- The DA would be required to disclose any remaining exculpatory evidence (e.g., text logs, surveillance, chain of custody files).

The DA did not:

- Move to quash the subpoena;
- Refute the affidavit’s truth;
- Explain why Davis was dropped from the charging documents;
- Acknowledge or rebut the 41+ day procedural default under Rule 8.54(c).

That is a Brady violation. It is also reversible error. See:

- *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963);
- *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419 (1995);
- *People v. Uribe* (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1457.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Rule immediately on all outstanding evidentiary motions before jury selection;
2. Admit the Sworn Affidavit of Emmanuel Davis into the record for all pretrial and appellate purposes;
3. Compel the appearance of Davis for testimony or grant relief under CCP §1987.1;
4. Require the People to disclose all remaining Brady materials or submit a declaration under penalty of perjury that none remain;
5. Issue written rulings under CCP §632 to preserve the appellate and habeas record;
6. Treat the People's 41-day default as a waiver under Rule 8.54(c) and grant the motion as unopposed.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The record is now uncontested:

- The People ignored the Davis affidavit and subpoena;
- The Court struck over 50 motions and failed to rule on over 20 more;
- 1,300 pages of discovery were withheld until the final days before trial;
- Defendant has received no ruling on evidentiary admissibility, witness testimony, or Brady compliance.

To deny this motion would result in structural due process error and risk an unconstitutional conviction. The Court must act now — or irreparably prejudice the defense and the record.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s **Emergency Motion to Compel Evidentiary Rulings, Preserve Exculpatory Material, and Compel Witness Testimony**, filed on March 27, 2025. The People’s opposition is vague, dismissive, and relies entirely on a generic claim that the motion is "repackaged" from others.

That is both **factually and procedurally incorrect**. This emergency motion:

- Seeks immediate judicial action **before trial**;
- Addresses the **failure to rule on filed motions**;
- Identifies ongoing **Brady violations** and suppressed witness evidence;
- Requests enforcement of subpoenas and preservation of due process rights.

The DA fails to respond to these points and instead hides behind the omnibus strategy. This is **waiver** under Rule 8.54(c), and it leaves this motion legally unopposed.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE ACTUAL MOTION

The DA claims that this motion “repackages” other filings and has been addressed "elsewhere." Yet:

- They do not cite the motion at all in their table of responses;
- They do not address Defendant’s **request for rulings** on pending motions;
- They do not explain why exculpatory evidence (Davis, Paradise, late discovery) was delayed or ignored;
- They do not explain why subpoenas for Emmanuel Davis were **ignored**, **unacknowledged**, and **never challenged**.

This is not “repackaged” — this is a distinct motion seeking **time-sensitive relief** the Court has so far withheld.

---

## III. THE COURT’S FAILURE TO RULE HAS CREATED STRUCTURAL PREJUDICE

As of the date of this filing:

- More than **20 substantive motions** remain **unruled**;
- The DA was allowed **51 days** to respond to Defendant’s motions;
- The Defendant was given **only 4 days** to reply;
- Over **1,300 pages** of discovery were dumped **after** the opposition deadline;
- Exculpatory evidence remains **excluded from the record** due to the Court’s inaction;
- Trial is scheduled for **April 9, 2025** — and Defendant still lacks **clarity on evidentiary admissibility, witness rulings, and suppression issues**.

This constitutes **structural due process prejudice**, in violation of:

- *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976);  
- *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court*, 27 Cal.3d 519 (1980);  
- *Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal*, 556 U.S. 868 (2009).

No litigant — especially a self-represented one — can be expected to proceed to trial without rulings on motions that directly affect evidence, witnesses, and the admissibility of discovery.

---

## IV. BRADY VIOLATIONS AND WITNESS SUPPRESSION CONTINUE UNCHECKED

This motion specifically sought enforcement and protection regarding:

- The **subpoena and affidavit of Emmanuel Davis**;
- The **omission of Melissa Paradise**;
- The **late production** of digital media and discovery, including over 1,300 withheld pages;
- The failure to rule on motions that demand suppression of that evidence.

The DA has **never contested Davis’s affidavit**, **never moved to quash his subpoena**, and has **not rebutted** his statements.

> Yet they proceed to trial without acknowledging any of these facts. That is textbook **Brady concealment and denial of access to witnesses**.

This motion asked the Court to address those issues before trial. The DA’s failure to answer is a waiver — and this Court must act.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Immediately rule** on all pending evidentiary motions before proceeding to trial;
2. **Compel enforcement of the subpoena for Emmanuel Davis** and admit his affidavit if he is obstructed or unavailable;
3. **Order the DA to identify any remaining withheld exculpatory materials**;
4. **Issue written rulings under CCP §632** so that Defendant may preserve his objections for appellate review;
5. Issue findings under **Brady v. Maryland**, **Kyles v. Whitley**, and **California Penal Code §1054.5** regarding witness suppression and discovery misconduct.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

This is an emergency motion because **trial cannot proceed under these conditions**. The DA’s silence is not compliance. It is concealment.

This Court has not ruled on motions critical to the fairness of trial, despite knowing:

- Key witnesses have been suppressed;
- Discovery has been withheld;
- And Defendant’s preparation has been obstructed by unequal deadlines and judicial inaction.

If the Court fails to act, this will become part of a record of **reversible structural error**. Defendant does not seek delay — he seeks the right to prepare and defend himself.

The time for rulings is now.
