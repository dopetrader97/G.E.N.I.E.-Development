Based on the content of your original **Motion for Judicial Inquiry** and your detailed **Reply Brief to the DA’s Omnibus Opposition**, I’ve revised and fortified your **Reply to the People’s Opposition to the Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct** to explicitly include their **pattern of misconduct**, as documented across:

- Suppressed discovery;
- Willful violation of court orders;
- Procedural manipulation;
- Brady/Franks violations;
- Misconduct by named officers.

Here is your complete, updated reply brief, professionally revised:

# ✅ REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT MISCONDUCT  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed in Omnibus §II.C)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

**DEFENDANT: REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**  
**IN SUI JURIS**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct. The opposition labels the motion “vague” and lacking evidence. In reality, the motion contains **specific factual allegations**, supported by a verified declaration and documentary exhibits, that warrant immediate judicial review.

The DA does not rebut the **substance** of the motion, nor deny that exculpatory witnesses were concealed, reports were falsified or incomplete, and critical discovery was withheld until days before trial.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAIL TO CONTEST THE SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS

Defendant’s motion sets forth detailed allegations that were **not rebutted**, including:

- **Suppression of Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise** from all discovery, despite being material eyewitnesses;
- **Misrepresentations in the warrant affidavit** by Detective Hall-Fein;
- **Delayed discovery** totaling over 1,300 pages, much of it disclosed on April 2–3, 2025;
- **Failure to comply with a court-ordered meet-and-confer**;
- **Ongoing concealment of exculpatory communications and forensic records**.

These facts are documented in the Defendant’s verified reply brief and declaration filed April 4, 2025. The People did not contest the sworn affidavit of Emmanuel Davis, the subpoena of Melissa Paradise, the surveillance footage, or the misconduct by Detectives Hall-Fein, Gomez, Acosta, and Ospina.

---

## III. THIS MOTION SEEKS JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT — NOT TRIAL RELIEF

This motion does **not seek suppression or dismissal**. It seeks a **formal judicial inquiry** into misconduct that undermines the fairness of these proceedings.

When the prosecution withholds Brady material, misleads the magistrate, and violates court orders, the Court has an **obligation to investigate**, even if no formal suppression motion is pending. See:

- *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court*, 27 Cal.3d 519 (1980)  
- *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419 (1995)  
- *United States v. Chapman*, 524 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2008)

The DA’s suggestion that no inquiry is needed because “there is no evidence” collapses under the weight of their own silence.

---

## IV. THE RECORD REFLECTS A PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT AND DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS

Defendant’s omnibus reply brief demonstrates a **pattern**, not a one-time error:

- **Davis’s affidavit** refutes the entire theory of criminal threats and was withheld;
- **Paradise**, who contradicts the complaining witness, was never contacted;
- **1,300 pages of late discovery** were dumped after months of noncompliance;
- **Emails from DDA Barnett** (Ex. G) confirm ongoing violations of Brady and §1054.7;
- **Surveillance evidence** and **exculpatory texts** were withheld for over four months;
- The DA **defied a direct court order** to meet and confer before March 29, 2025.

This is not speculation — it is **intentional procedural misconduct** documented in sworn filings. When a pattern of concealment is shown, a court **must** inquire. See *Mooney v. Holohan*, 294 U.S. 103 (1935); *Greer v. Burbank Police Dept.*, 192 Cal.App.3d 115 (1987).

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Grant Defendant’s Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct;
2. Order the District Attorney to file a sworn response addressing:
   - The omission of Davis and Paradise;
   - The origin and timing of suppressed discovery;
   - The failure to comply with court-ordered deadlines and disclosures;
3. Compel LAPD or involved agencies to submit declarations under penalty of perjury;
4. Issue findings under CCP §632 to preserve appellate and federal review rights.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

The DA has failed to respond meaningfully to a motion that is grounded in specific facts, supported by verified declarations, and reinforced by a pattern of suppression and defiance.

This is not merely a pretrial dispute — it is a breakdown of procedural integrity.

A judicial inquiry is not just permissible — it is required to prevent a trial based on redacted evidence, false affidavits, and concealed witnesses.

The motion must be granted.

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 omnibus opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct. The People summarily reject the motion, claiming it is “vague,” lacks “specificity,” and provides “no evidence.”

But the record proves otherwise. This motion is supported by:

- Suppressed witness statements;
- Misleading warrant affidavits;
- Late discovery dumps;
- Contradictions in police reports;
- Fabricated probable cause.

The motion calls for a basic judicial inquiry — not trial relief — and is well within this Court’s authority.

---

## II. THE DA'S CLAIM OF “VAGUENESS” IS REFUTED BY THE RECORD

The People claim the motion “does not make any particular assertions or provide any evidence of such misconduct.”

This is false. The motion:

- Specifically identifies misconduct by Detectives Hall-Fein, Gomez, Acosta, and Ospina;
- Cites the **omission of Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise** from all reports;
- Cites the **false narrative used in the warrant affidavit** to suggest a gun was used;
- Cites **conflicts between the original and unredacted reports**;
- References the **delayed discovery production**, including over **1,300 pages withheld** until April 2–3, 2025.

> It is not the Defendant's burden to prove the misconduct before the inquiry — it is the Court’s responsibility to evaluate whether sufficient concern exists to justify inquiry.

This Court has that authority under:

- *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court* (1980) 27 Cal.3d 519  
- *People v. Uribe* (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1457  
- Penal Code §1054.5 (sanctions and enforcement of discovery rules)

---

## III. THE MOTION REQUESTS INQUIRY — NOT TRIAL RELIEF

This motion does **not ask for a ruling on guilt, suppression, or dismissal**. It asks this Court to:

- Evaluate whether **law enforcement misconduct occurred**;
- Determine if material **Brady or Franks violations exist**;
- Compel answers regarding the omission of known exculpatory witnesses.

The DA attempts to dodge inquiry by saying “nothing to see here” — while failing to address:

- Why Davis was omitted from all reports;
- Why Paradise was never contacted;
- Why no audit trail for the firearm exists;
- Why material evidence was produced after the opposition deadline.

This is exactly when a judicial inquiry is appropriate — to ensure the fairness of proceedings **before trial**.

---

## IV. THE COURT HAS THE INHERENT POWER TO ORDER AN INQUIRY

Courts have the authority to initiate or grant a judicial inquiry based on:

- Systemic Brady violations;
- Affidavit misrepresentation;
- Investigatory misconduct;
- Discovery violations under **Penal Code §§1054.1–1054.5**;
- Or any pattern of conduct that threatens due process.

Here, the record shows that:

- Multiple Brady witnesses were omitted from discovery;
- The DA failed to meet and confer as ordered;
- Police reports were materially inconsistent;
- The affidavit used to obtain the warrant was incomplete and misleading.

That’s not speculation — that’s documented misconduct.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Grant Defendant’s Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct;
2. Order the DA to respond in writing regarding the omissions of Davis and Paradise;
3. Compel LAPD to submit a statement or file addressing suppression or misconduct concerns;
4. Issue findings under **CCP §632** to preserve these issues for appeal and record review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

This is not a fishing expedition. This is a motion based on **withheld statements, altered narratives, falsified probable cause, and suppressed discovery**.

The People’s refusal to address these facts — and the Court’s refusal to inquire — would itself be a due process violation.

This Court must not allow this pattern of misconduct to go unchecked. A judicial inquiry is the minimum step necessary to preserve the integrity of these proceedings.
