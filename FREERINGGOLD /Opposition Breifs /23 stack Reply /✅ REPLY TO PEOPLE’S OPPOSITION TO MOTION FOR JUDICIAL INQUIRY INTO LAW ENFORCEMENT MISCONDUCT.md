Let's go. 💼 You're on fire — here's your strategic **Reply Brief #8**, targeting one of the DA’s weakest responses yet:

---

# ✅ **REPLY TO PEOPLE’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT MISCONDUCT**  
**(Filed February 14, 2025 | Opposed by DA in Omnibus §II.C)**

---

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA**  
**COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES**  
**Case No.: 23CJCF00745-01**  
**Dept.: 128**  
**Judge: Hon. Terry A. Bork**  
**Hearing Date: April 8, 2025**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s April 3, 2025 omnibus opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct. The People summarily reject the motion, claiming it is “vague,” lacks “specificity,” and provides “no evidence.”

But the record proves otherwise. This motion is supported by:

- Suppressed witness statements;
- Misleading warrant affidavits;
- Late discovery dumps;
- Contradictions in police reports;
- Fabricated probable cause.

The motion calls for a basic judicial inquiry — not trial relief — and is well within this Court’s authority.

---

## II. THE DA'S CLAIM OF “VAGUENESS” IS REFUTED BY THE RECORD

The People claim the motion “does not make any particular assertions or provide any evidence of such misconduct.”

This is false. The motion:

- Specifically identifies misconduct by Detectives Hall-Fein, Gomez, Acosta, and Ospina;
- Cites the **omission of Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise** from all reports;
- Cites the **false narrative used in the warrant affidavit** to suggest a gun was used;
- Cites **conflicts between the original and unredacted reports**;
- References the **delayed discovery production**, including over **1,300 pages withheld** until April 2–3, 2025.

> It is not the Defendant's burden to prove the misconduct before the inquiry — it is the Court’s responsibility to evaluate whether sufficient concern exists to justify inquiry.

This Court has that authority under:

- *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court* (1980) 27 Cal.3d 519  
- *People v. Uribe* (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1457  
- Penal Code §1054.5 (sanctions and enforcement of discovery rules)

---

## III. THE MOTION REQUESTS INQUIRY — NOT TRIAL RELIEF

This motion does **not ask for a ruling on guilt, suppression, or dismissal**. It asks this Court to:

- Evaluate whether **law enforcement misconduct occurred**;
- Determine if material **Brady or Franks violations exist**;
- Compel answers regarding the omission of known exculpatory witnesses.

The DA attempts to dodge inquiry by saying “nothing to see here” — while failing to address:

- Why Davis was omitted from all reports;
- Why Paradise was never contacted;
- Why no audit trail for the firearm exists;
- Why material evidence was produced after the opposition deadline.

This is exactly when a judicial inquiry is appropriate — to ensure the fairness of proceedings **before trial**.

---

## IV. THE COURT HAS THE INHERENT POWER TO ORDER AN INQUIRY

Courts have the authority to initiate or grant a judicial inquiry based on:

- Systemic Brady violations;
- Affidavit misrepresentation;
- Investigatory misconduct;
- Discovery violations under **Penal Code §§1054.1–1054.5**;
- Or any pattern of conduct that threatens due process.

Here, the record shows that:

- Multiple Brady witnesses were omitted from discovery;
- The DA failed to meet and confer as ordered;
- Police reports were materially inconsistent;
- The affidavit used to obtain the warrant was incomplete and misleading.

That’s not speculation — that’s documented misconduct.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Grant Defendant’s Motion for Judicial Inquiry into Law Enforcement Misconduct;
2. Order the DA to respond in writing regarding the omissions of Davis and Paradise;
3. Compel LAPD to submit a statement or file addressing suppression or misconduct concerns;
4. Issue findings under **CCP §632** to preserve these issues for appeal and record review.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

This is not a fishing expedition. This is a motion based on **withheld statements, altered narratives, falsified probable cause, and suppressed discovery**.

The People’s refusal to address these facts — and the Court’s refusal to inquire — would itself be a due process violation.

This Court must not allow this pattern of misconduct to go unchecked. A judicial inquiry is the minimum step necessary to preserve the integrity of these proceedings.
