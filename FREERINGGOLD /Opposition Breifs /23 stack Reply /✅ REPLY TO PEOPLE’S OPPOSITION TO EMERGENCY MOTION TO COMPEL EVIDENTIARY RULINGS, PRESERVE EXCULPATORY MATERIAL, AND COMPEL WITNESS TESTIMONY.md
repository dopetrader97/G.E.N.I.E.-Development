**Dept.: 128**

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Reply addresses the People’s opposition to Defendant’s **Emergency Motion to Compel Evidentiary Rulings, Preserve Exculpatory Material, and Compel Witness Testimony**, filed on March 27, 2025. The People’s opposition is vague, dismissive, and relies entirely on a generic claim that the motion is "repackaged" from others.

That is both **factually and procedurally incorrect**. This emergency motion:

- Seeks immediate judicial action **before trial**;
- Addresses the **failure to rule on filed motions**;
- Identifies ongoing **Brady violations** and suppressed witness evidence;
- Requests enforcement of subpoenas and preservation of due process rights.

The DA fails to respond to these points and instead hides behind the omnibus strategy. This is **waiver** under Rule 8.54(c), and it leaves this motion legally unopposed.

---

## II. THE PEOPLE FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE ACTUAL MOTION

The DA claims that this motion “repackages” other filings and has been addressed "elsewhere." Yet:

- They do not cite the motion at all in their table of responses;
- They do not address Defendant’s **request for rulings** on pending motions;
- They do not explain why exculpatory evidence (Davis, Paradise, late discovery) was delayed or ignored;
- They do not explain why subpoenas for Emmanuel Davis were **ignored**, **unacknowledged**, and **never challenged**.

This is not “repackaged” — this is a distinct motion seeking **time-sensitive relief** the Court has so far withheld.

---

## III. THE COURT’S FAILURE TO RULE HAS CREATED STRUCTURAL PREJUDICE

As of the date of this filing:

- More than **20 substantive motions** remain **unruled**;
- The DA was allowed **51 days** to respond to Defendant’s motions;
- The Defendant was given **only 4 days** to reply;
- Over **1,300 pages** of discovery were dumped **after** the opposition deadline;
- Exculpatory evidence remains **excluded from the record** due to the Court’s inaction;
- Trial is scheduled for **April 9, 2025** — and Defendant still lacks **clarity on evidentiary admissibility, witness rulings, and suppression issues**.

This constitutes **structural due process prejudice**, in violation of:

- *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976);  
- *Pompa-Ortiz v. Superior Court*, 27 Cal.3d 519 (1980);  
- *Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal*, 556 U.S. 868 (2009).

No litigant — especially a self-represented one — can be expected to proceed to trial without rulings on motions that directly affect evidence, witnesses, and the admissibility of discovery.

## IV. BRADY VIOLATIONS AND WITNESS SUPPRESSION CONTINUE UNCHECKED

This motion specifically sought enforcement and protection regarding:

- The **subpoena and affidavit of Emmanuel Davis**;
- The **omission of Melissa Paradise**;
- The **late production** of digital media and discovery, including over 1,300 withheld pages;
- The failure to rule on motions that demand suppression of that evidence.

The DA has **never contested Davis’s affidavit**, **never moved to quash his subpoena**, and has **not rebutted** his statements.

> Yet they proceed to trial without acknowledging any of these facts. That is textbook **Brady concealment and denial of access to witnesses**.

This motion asked the Court to address those issues before trial. The DA’s failure to answer is a waiver — and this Court must act.

---

## V. RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Immediately rule** on all pending evidentiary motions before proceeding to trial;
2. **Compel enforcement of the subpoena for Emmanuel Davis** and admit his affidavit if he is obstructed or unavailable;
3. **Order the DA to identify any remaining withheld exculpatory materials**;
4. **Issue written rulings under CCP §632** so that Defendant may preserve his objections for appellate review;
5. Issue findings under **Brady v. Maryland**, **Kyles v. Whitley**, and **California Penal Code §1054.5** regarding witness suppression and discovery misconduct.

---

## VI. CONCLUSION

This is an emergency motion because **trial cannot proceed under these conditions**. The DA’s silence is not compliance. It is concealment.

This Court has not ruled on motions critical to the fairness of trial, despite knowing:

- Key witnesses have been suppressed;
- Discovery has been withheld;
- And Defendant’s preparation has been obstructed by unequal deadlines and judicial inaction.

If the Court fails to act, this will become part of a record of **reversible structural error**. Defendant does not seek delay — he seeks the right to prepare and defend himself.

The time for rulings is now.
