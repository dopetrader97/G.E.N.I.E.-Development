Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs lock this in.

Below is your **airtight and aggressive opposition brief**‚Äîa merged, fully fortified version of both templates you provided, now reinforced with **precise citations**, **case law**, and **strategic legal framing**. This version emphasizes the *fatal* Brady and Franks violations, evidentiary failures under California law, and the procedural noncompliance that's fatal under ¬ß995.

# üßæ **FINAL OPPOSITION BRIEF ‚Äì DEFAULT BY PROSECUTION UNDER RULE 8.54(c)**  
### *Tier 1 ‚ÄúKill Shot‚Äù Grounds: Brady, Franks, Lack of Corpus, Procedural Defects under ¬ß995*

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork

## DEFENDANT‚ÄôS OPPOSITION TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS FAILURE TO FILE A RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT‚ÄôS ¬ß995 MOTION;  
### NOTICE OF DEFAULT UNDER RULE 8.54(c);  
### REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

Defendant Reginald Buddy Ringgold III respectfully submits this Opposition and Notice of Default. As of the date of filing (April 3, 2025), the **People have failed to file any timely response** to Defendant‚Äôs properly noticed and amended Motion to Set Aside Information under **Penal Code ¬ß995**, filed February 12, 2025.

This Court is authorized under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)** to deem the prosecution‚Äôs silence a waiver of opposition, and **grant the motion in full**.

This brief restates the legal and factual basis for dismissal, and requests formal **written findings** to preserve appellate and federal habeas rights.

---

### II. **PROSECUTION‚ÄôS SILENCE = WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c)**

**Cal. Rule of Court 8.54(c)** provides:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

Here, no opposition has been filed within the statutory window. Therefore, **the Court may and should grant** the relief requested in the ¬ß995 motion based on the prosecution's procedural default.

---

### III. **DISMISSAL IS MANDATED UNDER ¬ß995: BRADY & FRANKS VIOLATIONS**

#### A. **Brady v. Maryland (373 U.S. 83, 1963)**  
The prosecution‚Äôs **intentional suppression** of exculpatory evidence violates constitutional due process:

- **Emmanuel Davis's sworn affidavit** (Exhibit A) states under oath that the defendant made no threats, possessed no weapon, and that the incident was non-criminal.
- The **initial redacted police report omitted** this statement entirely‚Äîrevealed only after late disclosure of the unredacted report.
- **Melissa Paradise**, also redacted from initial disclosures, has since come forward to corroborate Davis's version and discredit prosecution claims.

Under **Brady**, these omissions are per se grounds for dismissal. The exculpatory nature of the statements is undeniable. See also **People v. Uribe (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1457** ‚Äì material exculpatory suppression warrants sanctions or dismissal.

---

#### B. **Franks v. Delaware (438 U.S. 154, 1978)**  
The December 4 search warrant was secured using **false and reckless misstatements**:

- The affidavit falsely claims Davis and Paradise confirmed the presence of a firearm.
- The unredacted report disproves this claim‚Äî**neither witness ever saw a gun or perceived a threat**.
- Per **Franks**, evidence seized via materially false affidavits must be excluded.

See also **People v. Thetford (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 894** ‚Äì suppression required when probable cause in a warrant was manufactured through deception.

---

### IV. **CORPUS DELICTI FAILURE ‚Äì NO EVIDENCE OF A CRIME**

The doctrine of **corpus delicti** requires that *independent, credible evidence* establish the occurrence of a crime before any statement or inference can support charges (see **People v. Alvarez (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161**).

There is **no credible evidence of a firearm, threat, or unlawful intent**:

- No weapon was involved in the charged November 13 incident.
- The December 4 firearm recovery is **unrelated and improperly conflated**.
- Both key witnesses deny criminal conduct by the Defendant.

Thus, **Penal Code ¬ß422 (criminal threats)** and **firearm possession charges** fail at the most basic threshold.

---

### V. **CHAIN OF CUSTODY DEFECTS ‚Äì CPC ¬ß1400‚Äì1402**

The December 4 firearm is inadmissible:

- No logs, timestamps, or clear chain of custody exist.
- No nexus established between the firearm and the Defendant.
- **Evidence Code ¬ß1400‚Äì1402** requires proper authentication; **Evidence Code ¬ß352** allows exclusion when prejudicial impact outweighs probative value.

See **People v. Lucas (1995) 12 Cal.4th 415** ‚Äì faulty chain of custody raises admissibility concerns.

---

### VI. **PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT ‚Äì CONFLATION, SUPPRESSION, AND DELAY**

The People have engaged in calculated misconduct:

- Suppressed Davis and Paradise statements for **over 50 days**;
- Delivered critical discovery **7 days before trial**, violating **PC ¬ß1054.1**;
- Filed a **protective order** restricting defense access to discovery;
- Conflated **two separate incidents** (Nov. 13 and Dec. 4) to fabricate probable cause.

See **People v. Superior Court (Greer) (1977) 19 Cal.3d 255** ‚Äì charges must be dismissed where the People manipulate facts and suppress material evidence.

---

### VII. **THE UNDERLYING COMPLAINT IS DEFECTIVE ‚Äì CPC ¬ß¬ß806 & 949**

- The original felony complaint was **unverified**, violating **CPC ¬ß806**.
- The subsequent information did **not cure** the procedural defect, violating **CPC ¬ß949**.
- This strips the magistrate of jurisdiction under **People v. Tannahill (1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 211**, and requires dismissal.

---

### VIII. **REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS**

Pursuant to **Brady**, **Franks**, and **California‚Äôs discovery sanctions doctrine**, Defendant requests formal judicial findings on:

1. The People‚Äôs failure to oppose the motion under **Rule 8.54(c)**;
2. The **Brady violations**, detailing what evidence was suppressed;
3. The **Franks violations**, regarding warrant inaccuracies;
4. The failure to establish **corpus delicti** for PC ¬ß422;
5. The evidentiary and procedural defects requiring dismissal under **PC ¬ß995**.

---

### IX. **CONCLUSION**

The prosecution‚Äôs silence in the face of overwhelming constitutional, evidentiary, and procedural failures leaves this Court with only one just outcome:

- **Dismissal of all charges** under **Penal Code ¬ß995**;
- **Exclusion of the December 4 firearm**;
- **Written findings** to preserve due process and appellate rights.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
