# 🧾 REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OMNIBUS OPPOSITION  
### *Refuting April 2 Filing and Affirmatively Establishing Brady & Franks Violations*  

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply is submitted in response to the **District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition**, filed at **3:59 PM on April 2, 2025**, just minutes before the filing deadline. The opposition is **procedurally defective**, **factually misleading**, and **legally insufficient**, and fails to address the core **Brady**, **Franks**, and **due process violations**.

The newly disclosed **unredacted police reports**, released only **7 days before trial**, definitively confirm that exculpatory witness statements were:

- **Intentionally redacted**;
- **Mischaracterized in Detective Hall-Fein’s affidavit**;
- **Withheld for 50+ days**, prejudicing trial preparation.

The prosecution’s April 2 opposition is a last-ditch effort to obscure the record. It fails to rebut the factual content of the affidavit, the police reports, or the exculpatory statements now entered into the record.

---

## II. RULE 8.54(c) VIOLATION – OPPOSITION FILED UNTIMELY

Under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**:

> “If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”

The prosecution filed a consolidated omnibus opposition on April 2 — well beyond the 10-day statutory window for multiple motions filed on February 14. Procedurally, the opposition should be treated as a **waiver** under 8.54(c), and the relief sought in Defendant’s motions **should be granted by default**.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATIONS – MATERIAL EXCULPATORY STATEMENTS WITHHELD

### A. Emmanuel Davis Statement – Omitted and Redacted

**Discovery Part 1 (Unredacted), Pages 75–76**  
🗂**Redacted Police Report**: Entirely excludes Davis’s name, role, and statement.

**Unredacted content:**
> *“Davis stated he never saw Ringgold with a firearm... said he did not hear any threats and believed Ringgold was trying to calm things down.”*

This is **direct exculpatory evidence**, affirmatively denying any criminal conduct.  
**Omitted entirely** from the redacted version.

---

### B. Melissa Paradise Statement – Omitted and Redacted

**Discovery Part 2 (Unredacted), Page 132**  
🗂**Redacted Police Report**: Omitted completely — name and content absent.

**Unredacted content:**
> *“Paradise stated she did not see a gun during the incident. She also said she did not hear Ringgold make any threats and thought the situation was blown out of proportion.”*

This directly contradicts the prosecution’s case and the affidavit.  
Entirely omitted — **name not even mentioned** in redacted discovery.

---

### C. Legal Framework – Why This Is a Brady Violation

Under **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)** and **California Penal Code §1054.1**, the prosecution has a **constitutional and statutory duty** to disclose:

- Evidence that **negates guilt**;
- Witness statements that **undermine probable cause**;
- Testimony that is **material to the defense**.

The **50-day delay** and total redaction of these exculpatory witness statements was **not inadvertent** — it was strategic, prejudicial, and **unconstitutional**.

---

## IV. FRANKS VIOLATION – WARRANT AFFIDAVIT KNOWINGLY FALSE

Detective Hall-Fein’s affidavit claimed:

> *“Melissa Paradise and Joel Davis confirmed that Mr. Ringgold brandished a firearm and made threats to shoot.”*

This is demonstrably **false**:

- Davis: *“I never saw a gun. Never heard him make threats.”* (Pg. 75–76)
- Paradise: *“There was no gun that I saw. No threats.”* (Pg. 132)

These are **not omissions** — they are **fabrications** when misrepresented as corroborations.

Under **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)**, suppression is required where:

1. The affidavit contains **deliberate falsehoods or reckless disregard** for the truth;
2. **Removing those falsehoods** destroys probable cause.

That standard is met here. A **Franks hearing** must be granted, and all derivative evidence must be suppressed.

---

## V. CHAIN OF CUSTODY FAILURES REMAIN UNRESOLVED

Despite court orders and formal requests, the prosecution:

- Has not produced firearm transfer logs;
- Has not authenticated the evidence under **Evidence Code §§1400–1402**;
- Has not rebutted the Defendant’s motion showing a complete lack of foundation.

The firearm seized on December 4, 2023, is not tied to the alleged November 13 incident and was **prejudicially introduced** through tainted affidavit evidence.

---

## VI. TEXTS, EMAILS & SURVEILLANCE EXPOSE FALSE NARRATIVE

Recently disclosed communications (April 2, 2025) show:

- **Danny Fitzgerald** never perceived a threat;
- The alleged threats originated from a **false narrative told by Ms. Hardy**, not from Defendant;
- After the misunderstanding was cleared up, **apologies were exchanged** — not charges.

This undermines the factual basis for **Count 6 (Pen. Code §422)** and supports dismissal under **Pen. Code §995** for lack of probable cause.

---

## VII. DA’S OPPOSITION FALSELY CLAIMS “NO SUPPRESSED STATEMENTS IDENTIFIED”

The DA states:

> *“Defendant fails to identify any officer or statement that was suppressed.”*

This is patently false:

- **Officer**: Detective Hall-Fein, who authored the affidavit;
- **Statements**:  
  - Emmanuel Davis – Pages 75–76 (Exculpatory; redacted);  
  - Melissa Paradise – Page 132 (Exculpatory; omitted).

The redacted report **intentionally removed** these statements. The DA’s opposition ignores these facts and provides **no rebuttal**.

---

## VIII. EXHIBIT INDEX (Evidentiary Reference)

| Exhibit | Description | Discovery Page(s) | Relevance |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| C | Sworn Affidavit – Emmanuel Davis | N/A (Separate filing) | Directly refutes threat/firearm |
| C.1 | Police Report – Davis Statement | Pages 75–76 (Unredacted) | Misrepresented in affidavit |
| C.2 | Police Report – Paradise Statement | Page 132 (Unredacted) | Omitted from redacted report |
| F.4–F.6 | Texts/emails with Fitzgerald & others | Submitted April 2 | Disprove threat narrative |
| Redacted Report | Prior Discovery | Entirely omits key witnesses | Confirms suppression |
| Surveillance | Timestamps contradict timeline | To be presented | Factual impeachment |

---

## IX. REQUESTED RELIEF

1. **Disregard or strike Omnibus Opposition** under Rule 8.54(c);
2. **Grant a Franks hearing** and suppress all evidence obtained through the tainted warrant;
3. **Dismiss all charges** for:
   - Lack of probable cause under PC §995;
   - Due process violations;
   - Chain-of-custody failures;
4. **Issue written findings** confirming:
   - Brady violations;
   - Franks misstatements;
   - Discovery misconduct;
   - Procedural prejudice;
5. **Sanction the prosecution** for violating court orders and ethical duties.

---

## X. CONCLUSION

The redacted police report presented a **fabricated case narrative**. The unredacted report — disclosed only after a court-ordered meet-and-confer — proves the DA built this case on **false affidavits and suppressed testimony**.

This is no longer a question of legal interpretation — it is a matter of **fundamental fairness** and **constitutional integrity**.

Respectfully submitted,  
**Dated: April 4, 2025**  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris

BELOW IS AN OLD REPLY BRIEF THAT WE ARE NOT USING IT IS JUST FOR REFERENCE

# 🧾 REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OMNIBUS OPPOSITION  
### *Refuting Late Filing and Factual Misstatements – Brady, Franks, and Procedural Due Process Violations*  

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork  

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply addresses the **District Attorney’s Omnibus Opposition**, filed **April 2, 2025 at 3:59 PM**, mere minutes before the deadline and over **50 days after Defendant’s first motions** were filed. The Opposition is **procedurally untimely** and **factually unsupported**.

The **unredacted police report** (disclosed April 2, 2025) and **sworn evidence now on record** expose serious misconduct, including:

- **Brady violations**: suppression of direct exculpatory witness statements;
- **Franks violations**: knowingly false and misleading warrant affidavit;
- **Chain-of-custody failures**: for the December 4 firearm;
- **Due process violations**: for untimely and prejudicial discovery.

Accordingly, Defendant requests the Court **strike or disregard the untimely opposition**, issue **written findings**, and **grant all pending motions**.

---

## II. RULE 8.54(c) VIOLATION – OPPOSITION FILED MINUTES BEFORE DEADLINE

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> “If a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.”

The DA failed to file written oppositions within the 10-day statutory window. Their blanket filing on April 2 violates Rule 8.54(c) and should be deemed **procedurally waived**. This is part of an escalating pattern of delayed responses intended to prejudice Defendant's ability to meaningfully reply.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATIONS – MATERIAL EXCULPATORY STATEMENTS WITHHELD

### A. Key Witness Statements Were Redacted, Then Revealed

The **redacted police report**, originally provided to the defense, omitted entire pages containing statements by **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise**.

The **unredacted police report** now confirms:

- Davis stated:  
  > *“I never saw a gun. I never heard him [Ringgold] say anything threatening. He looked surprised and just wanted everyone to calm down.”*  
- Paradise stated:  
  > *“There was no gun that I saw. No threats. Nothing like that happened. I think everyone was just overwhelmed.”*

These **statements were redacted in full**, creating the **false impression** that Davis and Paradise confirmed a threat. This was not a clerical oversight — it was **intentional suppression** of material exculpatory evidence.

> Violates:  
> • Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)  
> • Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)  
> • California Penal Code § 1054.1

---

## IV. FRANKS VIOLATION – AFFIDAVIT CONTAINED KNOWINGLY FALSE CLAIMS

Detective Hall-Fein’s warrant affidavit stated:

> “Melissa Paradise and Joel Davis confirmed that Mr. Ringgold brandished a firearm and made threats to shoot.”

That is **materially false**.

The unredacted police report and Davis’s affidavit both confirm that:

- **No gun was seen**
- **No threats were made**
- **Both witnesses denied hearing or observing any criminal behavior**

This satisfies the two-prong test under **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)**:

1. The affiant **knowingly included false statements** or acted in **reckless disregard**;
2. Without the falsehoods, **probable cause collapses**.

> A Franks hearing is required.  
> The warrant must be invalidated.  
> All evidence derived from the search — including the December 4 firearm — must be suppressed.

---

## V. DISCOVERY DELAY – EXCULPATORY MATERIAL PRODUCED 7 DAYS BEFORE TRIAL

Despite repeated requests, the prosecution:

- Failed to turn over the unredacted report until **April 2, 2025** — 50 days after Defendant’s pro per appearance;
- Failed to disclose **text messages**, **emails**, and **surveillance evidence** until the same date;
- Delayed disclosure of **chain-of-custody documents**, some of which remain unproduced.

> Prejudice: Defendant had less than one week to prepare for trial with material evidence.  
> This violates due process and discovery timelines.

---

## VI. EXCULPATORY TEXTS & EMAILS FURTHER UNDERMINE THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

The April 2 discovery includes messages between:

- **Defendant and landlord Danny Fitzgerald** — confirming no threat was perceived and that misunderstandings arose due to **fabricated claims by Ms. Hardy**.
- **Defendant and Melissa Paradise** — confirming Paradise's willingness to testify and contradict the narrative of firearm threat.
- **Defendant and Joel Davis** — showing peaceful communication before and after the alleged incident.

These records were improperly withheld and should have been disclosed under **Brady** and **PC §1054.1**.

---

## VII. DA’S OPPOSITION MISREPRESENTS THE EVIDENCE

The DA falsely states:

> “Defendant does not name any officer or identify what was suppressed.”

That is categorically false:

- **Officer named**: Detective Catherine Hall-Fein (warrant affiant and report author)
- **What was suppressed**:
  - Full statements from Davis and Paradise denying any gun or threat;
  - Correspondence contradicting the prosecution’s narrative;
  - Chain-of-custody records for the firearm.

The DA has not refuted the content of the affidavit or the redactions — because **they cannot**.

| **A** | Exhibit C | Sworn Affidavit – Emmanuel Davis | N/A (Separate filing) | Directly refutes threat/firearm |

## IX. REQUESTED RELIEF

1. **Strike or disregard the Omnibus Opposition** as untimely under Rule 8.54(c);
2. **Grant all pending motions**, including:
   - Motion to Dismiss (Brady);
   - Motion to Suppress (Franks);
   - Motion to Dismiss (Fruit of the Poisonous Tree);
   - Motion to Compel (Chain of Custody);
3. **Issue written findings** detailing:
   - Brady suppression;
   - False affidavit content;
   - Chain-of-custody defects;
   - Discovery delays and prejudice;
4. **Dismiss all charges with prejudice**;
5. **Sanction prosecution if necessary**, for failure to comply with ethical and procedural duties.

---

## X. CONCLUSION

The DA’s April 2 opposition is **too late**, **factually inaccurate**, and **legally unsustainable**. The redacted report deliberately concealed the only two neutral eyewitnesses — both of whom denied a firearm and denied hearing any threats.

This case cannot proceed. It is constitutionally compromised at its root.

**Respectfully submitted,**  
Dated: April 4, 2025
