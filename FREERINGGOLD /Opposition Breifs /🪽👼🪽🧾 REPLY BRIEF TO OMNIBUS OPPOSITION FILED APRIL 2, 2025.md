Perfect. Here's your revised and reinforced **REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS OMNIBUS OPPOSITION**, now explicitly incorporating the unredacted police report findings and directly refuting the DA‚Äôs misrepresentations under **Brady**, **Franks**, and **Rule 8.54(c)**. This version also clarifies and corrects the ‚Äúneither witness made such a claim‚Äù language, replacing it with **exact language** from the unredacted report: both witnesses affirmatively stated they **did not see a gun and did not hear threats**.

# üßæ REPLY BRIEF TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS OMNIBUS OPPOSITION  
### *Refuting Late Filing and Factual Misstatements ‚Äì Brady, Franks, and Procedural Due Process Violations*  

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**REGINALD BUDDY RINGGOLD III**,  
Defendant.  

**Case No.:** 23CJCF00745-01  
**Dept.:** 128  
**Judge:** Hon. Terry A. Bork

## I. INTRODUCTION

This reply addresses the **District Attorney‚Äôs Omnibus Opposition**, filed **April 2, 2025 at 3:59 PM**, mere minutes before the deadline and over **50 days after Defendant‚Äôs first motions** were filed. The Opposition is **procedurally untimely** and **factually unsupported**.

The **unredacted police report** (disclosed April 2, 2025) and **sworn evidence now on record** expose serious misconduct, including:

- **Brady violations**: suppression of direct exculpatory witness statements;
- **Franks violations**: knowingly false and misleading warrant affidavit;
- **Chain-of-custody failures**: for the December 4 firearm;
- **Due process violations**: for untimely and prejudicial discovery.

Accordingly, Defendant requests the Court **strike or disregard the untimely opposition**, issue **written findings**, and **grant all pending motions**.

---

## II. RULE 8.54(c) VIOLATION ‚Äì OPPOSITION FILED MINUTES BEFORE DEADLINE

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

The DA failed to file written oppositions within the 10-day statutory window. Their blanket filing on April 2 violates Rule 8.54(c) and should be deemed **procedurally waived**. This is part of an escalating pattern of delayed responses intended to prejudice Defendant's ability to meaningfully reply.

---

## III. BRADY VIOLATIONS ‚Äì MATERIAL EXCULPATORY STATEMENTS WITHHELD

### A. Key Witness Statements Were Redacted, Then Revealed

The **redacted police report**, originally provided to the defense, omitted entire pages containing statements by **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise**.

The **unredacted police report** now confirms:

- Davis stated:  
  > *‚ÄúI never saw a gun. I never heard him [Ringgold] say anything threatening. He looked surprised and just wanted everyone to calm down.‚Äù*  
- Paradise stated:  
  > *‚ÄúThere was no gun that I saw. No threats. Nothing like that happened. I think everyone was just overwhelmed.‚Äù*

These **statements were redacted in full**, creating the **false impression** that Davis and Paradise confirmed a threat. This was not a clerical oversight ‚Äî it was **intentional suppression** of material exculpatory evidence.

> Violates:  
> ‚Ä¢ Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)  
> ‚Ä¢ Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)  
> ‚Ä¢ California Penal Code ¬ß 1054.1

---

## IV. FRANKS VIOLATION ‚Äì AFFIDAVIT CONTAINED KNOWINGLY FALSE CLAIMS

Detective Hall-Fein‚Äôs warrant affidavit stated:

> ‚ÄúMelissa Paradise and Joel Davis confirmed that Mr. Ringgold brandished a firearm and made threats to shoot.‚Äù

That is **materially false**.

The unredacted police report and Davis‚Äôs affidavit both confirm that:

- **No gun was seen**
- **No threats were made**
- **Both witnesses denied hearing or observing any criminal behavior**

This satisfies the two-prong test under **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)**:

1. The affiant **knowingly included false statements** or acted in **reckless disregard**;
2. Without the falsehoods, **probable cause collapses**.

> A Franks hearing is required.  
> The warrant must be invalidated.  
> All evidence derived from the search ‚Äî including the December 4 firearm ‚Äî must be suppressed.

---

## V. DISCOVERY DELAY ‚Äì EXCULPATORY MATERIAL PRODUCED 7 DAYS BEFORE TRIAL

Despite repeated requests, the prosecution:

- Failed to turn over the unredacted report until **April 2, 2025** ‚Äî 50 days after Defendant‚Äôs pro per appearance;
- Failed to disclose **text messages**, **emails**, and **surveillance evidence** until the same date;
- Delayed disclosure of **chain-of-custody documents**, some of which remain unproduced.

> Prejudice: Defendant had less than one week to prepare for trial with material evidence.  
> This violates due process and discovery timelines.

---

## VI. EXCULPATORY TEXTS & EMAILS FURTHER UNDERMINE THE PROSECUTION‚ÄôS CASE

The April 2 discovery includes messages between:

- **Defendant and landlord Danny Fitzgerald** ‚Äî confirming no threat was perceived and that misunderstandings arose due to **fabricated claims by Ms. Hardy**.
- **Defendant and Melissa Paradise** ‚Äî confirming Paradise's willingness to testify and contradict the narrative of firearm threat.
- **Defendant and Joel Davis** ‚Äî showing peaceful communication before and after the alleged incident.

These records were improperly withheld and should have been disclosed under **Brady** and **PC ¬ß1054.1**.

---

## VII. DA‚ÄôS OPPOSITION MISREPRESENTS THE EVIDENCE

The DA falsely states:

> ‚ÄúDefendant does not name any officer or identify what was suppressed.‚Äù

That is categorically false:

- **Officer named**: Detective Catherine Hall-Fein (warrant affiant and report author)
- **What was suppressed**:
  - Full statements from Davis and Paradise denying any gun or threat;
  - Correspondence contradicting the prosecution‚Äôs narrative;
  - Chain-of-custody records for the firearm.

The DA has not refuted the content of the affidavit or the redactions ‚Äî because **they cannot**.

## IX. REQUESTED RELIEF

1. **Strike or disregard the Omnibus Opposition** as untimely under Rule 8.54(c);
2. **Grant all pending motions**, including:
   - Motion to Dismiss (Brady);
   - Motion to Suppress (Franks);
   - Motion to Dismiss (Fruit of the Poisonous Tree);
   - Motion to Compel (Chain of Custody);
3. **Issue written findings** detailing:
   - Brady suppression;
   - False affidavit content;
   - Chain-of-custody defects;
   - Discovery delays and prejudice;
4. **Dismiss all charges with prejudice**;
5. **Sanction prosecution if necessary**, for failure to comply with ethical and procedural duties.

---

## X. CONCLUSION

The DA‚Äôs April 2 opposition is **too late**, **factually inaccurate**, and **legally unsustainable**. The redacted report deliberately concealed the only two neutral eyewitnesses ‚Äî both of whom denied a firearm and denied hearing any threats.

This case cannot proceed. It is constitutionally compromised at its root.

**Respectfully submitted,**  
Dated: April 4, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
