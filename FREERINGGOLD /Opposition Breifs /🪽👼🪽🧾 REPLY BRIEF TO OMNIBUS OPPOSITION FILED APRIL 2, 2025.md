## DEFENDANT‚ÄôS COMPREHENSIVE REPLY TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS OMNIBUS OPPOSITION;  
### CLARIFICATION OF FACTUAL MISREPRESENTATIONS;  
### NOTICE OF LATE OPPOSITION, WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c), AND REQUEST FOR FINDINGS

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

The **District Attorney's Omnibus Opposition**, filed at 4:00 PM on **April 2, 2025**, **falls outside the statutory window for timely opposition** and should be treated as **procedurally waived** under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**.

Even if the Court elects to review the substance, the Opposition fails to refute the documented misconduct, Brady violations, and false statements exposed in:

- The **unredacted police report**;
- The **sworn affidavit of Emmanuel Davis**;
- The **anticipated testimony of Melissa Paradise**;
- The procedural history and failure to timely produce discovery.

The DA‚Äôs arguments are **conclusory**, legally **mischaracterized**, and **factually contradicted** by the record. Dismissal remains the only constitutionally sound remedy.

---

### II. LATE OPPOSITION = WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c)

Rule 8.54(c) states:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

Many of the Defendant‚Äôs motions ‚Äî including the Brady-based dismissal, Franks suppression, and judicial inquiry ‚Äî were filed on or shortly after **February 14, 2025**. The DA was aware of these filings for weeks yet failed to respond until **April 2, 2025**, less than **24 hours before the hearing**, despite multiple notices and demands for timely opposition.

The DA‚Äôs blanket claim that the Court only gave ‚Äúclarity‚Äù on March 24, 2025, is disingenuous. Many of the motions in question were refiled or amended after pro per status was granted. Moreover, Defendant filed a **Preemptive Objection to Late Opposition** (March 27, 2025) now confirmed by this conduct.

The Court may, and should, **disregard** the opposition as untimely.

### III. THE DA MISREPRESENTS THE BRADY VIOLATION & DISCOVERY TIMELINE

#### A. **Undisputed Facts:**
- The **redacted police report concealed** exculpatory statements from **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise**;
- These statements were not disclosed until the **unredacted report** was turned over **on or after March 26, 2025**, more than **50 days** after initial discovery;
- Davis‚Äôs **notarized affidavit**, served February 14, 2025, explicitly **denies seeing any firearm**, hearing any threats, or observing any crime;
- Paradise independently came forward on **April 1, 2025**, confirming the same ‚Äî and **was also redacted** from discovery.

#### B. **DA‚Äôs Omnibus Opposition Fails to Refute These Points**
The DA provides:
- **No explanation for the redactions**;
- **No denial of delayed production**;
- **No contradiction of Davis‚Äôs sworn statements**;
- No reason why Davis‚Äôs and Paradise‚Äôs statements weren‚Äôt disclosed prior to March 2025.

Instead, the Opposition relies on boilerplate hearsay objections and asserts that discovery ‚Äúwas provided‚Äù ‚Äî without addressing the **deliberate suppression and redaction of core exculpatory evidence**.

> See: **Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)**;  
> **Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)**;  
> **United States v. Chapman, 524 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2008)**.

---

### IV. DA‚ÄôS DENIAL OF WITNESS TAMPERING IGNORES SWORN AFFIDAVIT & RECORD

The DA summarily denies witness coercion, claiming Defendant ‚Äúfails to name any officer‚Äù ‚Äî while completely ignoring:

- Davis‚Äôs **direct statement** that he was pressured and discouraged from testifying;
- The **absence of any documentation** of LAPD‚Äôs interviews with Davis;
- The **DA‚Äôs refusal to subpoena Davis**, despite his relevance to core allegations.

Witness tampering is supported by Davis‚Äôs sworn affidavit and corroborated by the redactions themselves. The DA‚Äôs omission of any rebuttal shows the **truth of these claims**.

> See: **18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1512**; **CPC ¬ß136.1**;  
> **Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973)**.

---

### V. DA MISSTATES THE FRANKS STANDARD

The DA incorrectly claims Defendant failed to make a ‚Äúspecific showing‚Äù under **Franks v. Delaware**. However:

- Davis and Paradise‚Äôs **statements were falsely attributed** in the warrant affidavit;
- The affidavit stated they ‚Äúcorroborated presence of a firearm‚Äù ‚Äî which they **explicitly denied**;
- This directly contradicts the factual basis of the warrant.

A **Franks hearing is required** when material misstatements or omissions undermine probable cause. The affidavit's falsity is clear, specific, and substantiated ‚Äî the DA‚Äôs response is not.

> See: **Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)**;  
> **People v. Thetford, 39 Cal.App.3d 894 (1974)**.

---

### VI. CORPUS DELICTI ARGUMENT IGNORED

The DA fails to engage with the **lack of independent evidence** for:

- A threat on November 13;
- Possession or use of a firearm;
- Any crime committed.

There is no corpus delicti. The DA simply asserts ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not relying solely on statements‚Äù ‚Äî but **provides no evidence** of a crime independent of those statements.

> See: **People v. Alvarez, 27 Cal.4th 1161 (2002)**.

---

### VII. CHAIN OF CUSTODY & EVIDENTIARY DEFICIENCIES

The DA claims the chain of custody was ‚Äúestablished‚Äù at the preliminary hearing, citing **hearsay from Proposition 115 testimony** ‚Äî not documentary proof.

No logs, no tags, no timestamps, and no continuous custody of the December 4 firearm have been produced. The item remains unauthenticated, irrelevant to the November 13 allegations, and **inadmissible under California Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402**.

---

### VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

Given the untimely opposition, unrefuted evidence, and pattern of prosecutorial and investigative misconduct, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Reject the Omnibus Opposition as untimely** under Rule 8.54(c);
2. **Grant all Tier 1 motions in full**, including:
   - Motion to Dismiss (Brady Violation);
   - Motion to Dismiss (Witness Tampering);
   - Motion to Suppress (Franks/PC ¬ß1538.5);
   - Motion to Dismiss (Fruit of the Poisonous Tree);
   - Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Corpus Delicti;
   - Motion for Sanctions;
   - Motion for Judicial Inquiry;
3. **Issue written findings** confirming the DA‚Äôs waiver of opposition and the factual record supporting dismissal;
4. **Dismiss all remaining charges with prejudice**.

---

### IX. CONCLUSION

The DA‚Äôs last-minute filing cannot erase months of silence, discovery violations, false affidavits, and evidence suppression. The law is clear. The record is clear. The prejudice is irreversible.

This Court must act to protect due process, uphold Brady, and restore public trust in these proceedings.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 4, 2025  
**Reginald Buddy Ringgold III**  
Defendant, In Sui Juris
