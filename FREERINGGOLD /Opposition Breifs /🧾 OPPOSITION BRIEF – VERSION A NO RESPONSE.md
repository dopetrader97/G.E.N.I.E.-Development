Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs begin drafting your **opposition briefs** now. Based on your explicitly detailed breakdown and your strategic focus, we‚Äôll structure each **brief tailored to the likely DA response scenarios**.

To be clear, we are *not drafting new motions*, but **replying in opposition** to any response (or lack thereof) by the DA, using the **newly disclosed unredacted police report**, the **sworn Davis affidavit**, and the **anticipated exculpatory testimony of Melissa Paradise**.

# üßæ **OPPOSITION BRIEF ‚Äì VERSION A**
### *DA Fails to File Any Response (Default under Rule 8.54(c))*

---

## SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA  
### COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  

**People of the State of California**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**[Your Full Name]**,  
Defendant.  

Case No.: [Case Number]  
Dept.: [Department]  
Judge: [Judge's Name]  

**DEFENDANT‚ÄôS OPPOSITION TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY‚ÄôS FAILURE TO FILE RESPONSE TO MOTIONS; NOTICE OF DEFAULT; REQUEST FOR WRITTEN FINDINGS**

---

### I. **INTRODUCTION**

Defendant respectfully submits this opposition brief and notifies the Court that the **People have failed to file any timely response** to Defendant‚Äôs previously filed motions, including:

- Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Penal Code ¬ß995 (Brady Violation)
- Motion to Suppress Evidence (Franks v. Delaware; PC ¬ß1538.5)
- Motion to Compel Chain of Custody Documentation
- Motion to Dismiss for Prosecutorial Misconduct

Under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**, the People‚Äôs failure to respond **waives opposition**, and the Court is empowered to grant the relief sought.  

---

### II. **FAILURE TO RESPOND ‚Äì WAIVER UNDER RULE 8.54(c)**

California Rule of Court 8.54(c) provides:

> ‚ÄúIf a party does not timely file an opposition, the court may deem the failure to oppose a waiver of opposition and grant the motion.‚Äù

As of April 3, 2025, the prosecution has failed to respond within the statutory time frame. Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court deem all opposition waived and **grant all pending motions in full**.

---

### III. **MOTION TO DISMISS ‚Äì BRADY VIOLATIONS EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED**

Newly disclosed evidence explicitly proves that the prosecution and investigators **intentionally omitted** the exculpatory witness statements of **Emmanuel Davis** and **Melissa Paradise** from both the discovery and the redacted police report:

- Davis's sworn affidavit (Exhibit A) clearly states that no firearm was ever seen or threatened, and that the Defendant engaged in no aggressive behavior.
- Paradise is now a willing witness as of April 1, 2025, whose exculpatory statements were clearly redacted and deliberately omitted from initial discovery.

This is an explicit violation of **Brady v. Maryland (1963)** and **California Penal Code ¬ß1054.1**, warranting **dismissal of charges under Penal Code ¬ß995**.

---

### IV. **MOTION TO SUPPRESS ‚Äì FRANKS VIOLATIONS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED**

The **search warrant affidavit submitted by Detectives Hall-Fein and Gomez** falsely represented that Davis and Paradise corroborated the presence of a firearm. The **unredacted report** now shows both witnesses explicitly denied any firearm or threats.

Under **Franks v. Delaware (1978)**, any evidence obtained via a warrant **containing material falsehoods or reckless omissions** must be suppressed. The December 4 firearm was seized in reliance on that defective warrant and must therefore be excluded.

---

### V. **CHAIN OF CUSTODY ‚Äì EVIDENCE CODE ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402 VIOLATION**

The People have **failed to provide any reliable chain of custody documentation** regarding the firearm recovered on December 4. This recovery was:

- **Unrelated** to the November 13 allegations;
- Documented without proper logs, timestamps, or transfer records;
- Potentially contaminated, altered, or misattributed.

Pursuant to **Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400-1402**, the lack of authentication renders this evidence inadmissible. Moreover, its admission would be more prejudicial than probative under **Evidence Code ¬ß352**.

---

### VI. **PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT ‚Äì CONFLATION & SUPPRESSION**

The prosecution has:

- Deliberately conflated the **unrelated December 4 incident** with the **November 13 charges**, in a calculated effort to inflame prejudice;
- Filed a **protective order** explicitly aimed at suppressing defense access to critical evidence of police misconduct;
- Failed to meet **court-ordered discovery deadlines** and meet-and-confer obligations (March 28, 2025).

These actions constitute **prosecutorial misconduct** that further supports dismissal or severe evidentiary sanctions.

---

### VII. **REQUEST FOR WRITTEN JUDICIAL FINDINGS**

To preserve appellate and potential federal habeas corpus rights, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court issue **written findings** detailing:

1. The DA‚Äôs failure to respond;
2. Any granted relief and the legal basis;
3. Brady, Franks, and chain-of-custody violations found on the record.

---

### VIII. **CONCLUSION**

In light of the People‚Äôs failure to respond and the extensive constitutional and evidentiary violations documented in the unredacted discovery, Defendant respectfully requests:

- **All motions be granted in full**;
- **Exclusion of the December 4 firearm**;
- **Dismissal of the charges**;
- **Judicial findings issued in writing**.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: April 3, 2025  
[Your Name]  
**Defendant, In Pro Per** (or your attorney‚Äôs name if represented)
