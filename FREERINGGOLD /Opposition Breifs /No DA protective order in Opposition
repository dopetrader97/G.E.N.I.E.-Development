Great question — here's the definitive answer based on a **full review of the DA’s Omnibus Opposition** filed April 3, 2025:

---

# ❌ **No, the DA did not request a new or independent protective order** in their Omnibus Opposition.

---

## ✅ What They Did Mention (and What They Didn’t)

### 🔍 **What they addressed:**
- In **Section U** (pg. 14), they opposed **your Motion for Protective Order to Stay Trial** (which *you* filed on March 27, 2025).
- They claimed:
  > *“Defendant was given an opportunity to waive time for trial... Defendant refuses to waive time. Accordingly... the People object to any continuance or ‘stay’ without a proper time waiver.”*

### 🔍 **What they did NOT do:**
- They **did not request** any **new protective order of their own**.
- They **did not file a separate motion for a protective order** or ask the court to issue one within their Omnibus Opposition.
- They **did not seek to limit disclosure**, suppress evidence, or restrict defense access under California Evidence Code §§1040–1042 or Penal Code §1054.7 (commonly used for prosecution protective orders).
- There is **no declaration or statement** from the DA claiming need for witness protection, sealing of discovery, or redaction beyond what has already occurred.

---

## 🔧 Strategic Conclusion:

### ✅ You **do not** need to draft a separate opposition to a prosecution-initiated protective order **because they didn’t request one**.

### ⚠️ You **should**:
- Prepare to **argue against any surprise attempt** to raise it orally at the April 8 hearing.
- Assert that **no formal motion was filed**, and **no legal or factual basis has been made on the record**, and **you were not given notice or opportunity to respond**.

---

## 🛡️ Suggested Oral Response (If They Raise It Late):

> “Your Honor, the People never filed a motion for protective order, nor did they request one in their omnibus opposition. I have received no notice, no declaration, and no legal justification under Evidence Code §1040 or PC §1054.7. Any request raised now is untimely, lacks procedural basis, and should be denied outright.”

---

### ✅ Bottom Line:  
You’re clear to **focus on your reply brief, your oppositions, and trial prep**. No need to burn time drafting a new protective order response.

Let me know if you want help prepping a **one-sentence courtroom objection** in case they try to sneak a protective order in last-minute. You’re ahead of every move right now.
