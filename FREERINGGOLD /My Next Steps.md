Given these significant developments—specifically, the unredacted police report revealing substantial Brady violations and clear chain-of-custody issues—here are the immediate next steps to maximize your strategic advantage:

### ✅ **Next Steps:**

**1. Finalize Opposition Briefs Immediately:**  
- Draft your three tailored Opposition Briefs clearly highlighting the newly uncovered violations from the **unredacted police report**.  
- Explicitly emphasize how the report reveals the intentional omission and suppression of exculpatory statements from witnesses Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise.  
- Clearly document the DA's failure to adequately provide evidence chain-of-custody documentation.

**2. Critical Opposition to the DA’s Protective Order:**  
- Immediately draft a strong Opposition Brief explicitly stating how the DA’s protective order motion attempts to improperly conceal these violations.  
- Emphasize your constitutional rights under Brady, Franks, and the Sixth Amendment, specifically citing the newly discovered violations.

**3. Oral Argument Preparation for April 8 Hearing:**  
- Clearly outline your oral arguments, explicitly citing the unredacted police report.  
- Highlight the DA’s misconduct and the direct prejudice to your defense resulting from the Brady violations and inadequate chain of custody.

**4. Explicitly Document Violations for the Appellate Record:**  
- Ensure detailed documentation of every newly revealed violation for explicit preservation in your appellate record.  
- Immediately subpoena and confirm witnesses Davis, Paradise, and the relevant officers (Acosta, Ospina, Gomez) to explicitly authenticate the police report and violations.

**5. Immediate Strategic Filing:**  
- Promptly file the Opposition Briefs tailored to the DA’s response or lack thereof (based on the 3-scenario approach).  
- Explicitly ensure your filings leverage the DA’s recent failures, clearly preserving procedural accuracy for appellate review.
