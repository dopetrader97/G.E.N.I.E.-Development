💼 Got it, Bailey. Dersh coming through with the full investigative package for tomorrow’s legal showdown.

## 🧾 WITNESS SUMMARY MEMOS – FINALIZED

---

### 👤 **Witness: Emmanuel Davis**  
**Status:** Formerly listed “victim” in Counts 2 & 4 (now dismissed).  
**Suppressed Evidence:** Never mentioned in redacted/unredacted reports. No police contact.  
**Affidavit:** Submitted March 24, 2025 (Exhibit C).  
**Statement Summary:**
- Was present during Nov 13, 2023 incident.
- Never saw a firearm.
- Never heard threats.
- Witnessed Defendant de-escalating the situation.
- Was never contacted by police.
- States he told prosecutor and investigating officer this directly.

**Strategic Legal Value:**
- *Brady* exculpatory material — suppressed.
- *Franks* violation — omitted from affidavit used to obtain warrant.
- *Crane v. Kentucky* — exclusion of this testimony impairs defense.
- Restriction of access (restraining order) made contact impossible during key pretrial period.

### 👤 **Witness: Melissa Paradise**  
**Status:** Eyewitness — named by DA’s key witness (Ms. Hardy).  
**Suppressed Evidence:** No police report, no interview, no disclosure.  
**Subpoena Status:** Issued by defense, confirmed willingness to testify.  
**Statement Summary:**
- Present at scene on Nov 13, 2023.
- Saw no firearm.
- Heard no threats.
- Observed Defendant trying to calm others.
- Has never been contacted by law enforcement.
- Will testify under oath to these facts.

**Strategic Legal Value:**
- Her omission is a deliberate suppression of eyewitness material.
- Her testimony directly contradicts the narrative used to charge Defendant.
- No effort was made by law enforcement to contact or document her perspective — selective investigation.
