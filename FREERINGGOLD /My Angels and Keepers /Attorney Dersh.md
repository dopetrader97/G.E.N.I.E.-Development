### I. 🔎 EVIDENCE & WITNESS SUPPRESSION — MEMO HIGHLIGHTS

#### 🔻 **Emmanuel Davis**  
**Status:** Counts 2 & 4 named victim. Charges dropped.  
**Findings:**

- Gave sworn affidavit (Exhibit C) stating:
  - Saw no weapon.
  - Heard no threats.
  - Witnessed Defendant de-escalating.
- Affidavit submitted March 24, 2025. Motion to admit still pending.

🔗 **Legal Leverage:**
- *Brady*, *Giglio*, *Kyles* — Material exculpatory witness actively hidden.
- *Napue v. Illinois* — False impression allowed to stand at prelim via omission.
- *Franks v. Delaware* — Misleading warrant affidavit excluding Davis’s exculpation.

---

#### 🔻 **Melissa Paradise**  
**Status:** Eyewitness named by Ms. Hardy (DA’s witness).  
**Findings:**
- Never contacted by police.
- Not listed in any discovery (confirmed on record).
- Confirmed to defense that:
  - She was present.
  - Saw no weapon.
  - Witnessed Defendant attempting to calm situation.
- Willing to testify; defense issued subpoena and formal notice.

🔗 **Legal Leverage:**
- *Brady* violation by omission.
- *Crane v. Kentucky* — Defense denied right to present favorable witness narrative.
- Materiality proven via corroboration by Davis.

---

### II. 🔍 CHAIN OF CUSTODY: INADMISSIBLE FIREARM

**Timeline:**
- Alleged incident: Nov 13, 2023.
- Firearm "found": Dec 4, 2023 — 3 weeks later.
- No documented chain of custody.
- No transfer logs, no storage documentation, no physical tie to November incident.

🔗 **Legal Leverage:**
- CA Evidence Code §§1400–1402.
- *People v. Lucas*, 12 Cal.4th 415 — No authentication = inadmissible.
- *Wong Sun v. United States* — Poisonous tree applies to derivative evidence.

### III. 🧾 SUPPRESSION TIMELINE (KEY FOR ORAL ARGUMENT)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Nov 13, 2023** | Incident occurs — Davis & Paradise present |

### IV. 🔨 STRATEGIC WEAPONRY FOR HEARING

**Ready-to-deploy script lines:**

- _“The prosecution engineered this case by omission. We now have two material eyewitnesses — both known to law enforcement — both left out of reports, both exculpatory. That’s not negligence. That’s deliberate concealment.”_

- _“The firearm lacks chain of custody, temporal nexus, and testimonial validation. The Court has not seen one authenticated log tying it to the night of November 13th.”_

- _“Trial cannot proceed while foundational motions remain unanswered, Brady disclosures remain incomplete, and key witnesses remain unruled. That is structural prejudice per *Crane* and *Mathews*.”_

### V. NEXT MOVE

- **I’ll finalize the witness summary memos for Davis and Paradise**
- **Compile the physical/discovery absence audit**
- **Draft suppression timeline slide for Johnny's oral argument**

Bailey, this case is a pressure-cooked Brady grenade. All we need is judicial touchpaper.

Call the next play. Want the memos, the visual slide, or a witness timeline chart next?

💼 Got it, Bailey. Dersh coming through with the full investigative package for tomorrow’s legal showdown.

## 🧾 WITNESS SUMMARY MEMOS – FINALIZED

---

### 👤 **Witness: Emmanuel Davis**  
**Status:** Formerly listed “victim” in Counts 2 & 4 (now dismissed).  
**Suppressed Evidence:** Never mentioned in redacted/unredacted reports. No police contact.  
**Affidavit:** Submitted March 24, 2025 (Exhibit C).  
**Statement Summary:**
- Was present during Nov 13, 2023 incident.
- Never saw a firearm.
- Never heard threats.
- Witnessed Defendant de-escalating the situation.
- Was never contacted by police.
- States he told prosecutor and investigating officer this directly.

**Strategic Legal Value:**
- *Brady* exculpatory material — suppressed.
- *Franks* violation — omitted from affidavit used to obtain warrant.
- *Crane v. Kentucky* — exclusion of this testimony impairs defense.
- Restriction of access (restraining order) made contact impossible during key pretrial period.

---

### 👤 **Witness: Melissa Paradise**  
**Status:** Eyewitness — named by DA’s key witness (Ms. Hardy).  
**Suppressed Evidence:** No police report, no interview, no disclosure.  
**Subpoena Status:** Issued by defense, confirmed willingness to testify.  
**Statement Summary:**
- Present at scene on Nov 13, 2023.
- Saw no firearm.
- Heard no threats.
- Observed Defendant trying to calm others.
- Has never been contacted by law enforcement.
- Will testify under oath to these facts.

**Strategic Legal Value:**
- Her omission is a deliberate suppression of eyewitness material.
- Her testimony directly contradicts the narrative used to charge Defendant.
- No effort was made by law enforcement to contact or document her perspective — selective investigation.

| **Melissa Paradise Report**      | Absent. No report, summary, or officer notes.       | Brady violation. Shows selective investigation.|
| **Surveillance Video**           | Disclosed April 2, 2025 — late.                     | Brady timing violation under PC §1054.7        |
| **Davis Affidavit Ruling**       | Still pending. No hearing granted.                  | Due process denial.                            |
| **Subpoena Enforcement (Davis)** | No enforcement or ruling.                          | Violates right to present defense under Crane. |
