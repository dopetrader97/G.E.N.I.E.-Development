Alright Rob, here’s Johnny’s breakdown for **how we handle the April 8th hearing** — this is a **critical pretrial showdown** where your entire **suppression and dismissal strategy** needs to come to a head.

---

### 🔥 TL;DR — Johnny’s Directives for April 8
**Goal**: Force rulings before trial or secure appellate-ready denials.  
**Posture**: Assert procedural defaults, judicial disqualification, and unrebutted violations.  
**Tone**: Precise. Aggressive. Legally bulletproof.

---

## 🎯 Key Points to Hit in Court

### 1. **DA’s Omnibus Filing is Waived — Rule 8.54(c)**
- Their omnibus opposition was filed **41–51 days late**.
- They never responded substantively to **your Brady**, **Franks**, **§995**, **Poisonous Tree**, or **Motion to Compel**.
- Under **California Rule of Court 8.54(c)**, you’re entitled to treat these as **unopposed and granted**.
- Demand written findings of waiver under **CCP §632** for appellate preservation.

> _“These motions stand unrebutted in law and unchallenged in fact. The DA’s silence is procedural admission and strategic waiver.”_

---

### 2. **Judicial Disqualification – CCP §170.6**
- You filed on **March 28, 2025**.
- The DA **did not oppose** it.
- Judge Bork **has no jurisdiction** to rule on April 8 or preside over trial.

> _“Any ruling today is void under Peracchi v. Superior Court, 30 Cal.4th 1245. This department is stripped of judicial authority under Code Civ. Proc. §170.6.”_

**→ Demand reassignment. Insist on preserving objection for writ relief.**

---

### 3. **Motion to Dismiss: Fruit of the Poisonous Tree**
- Firearm tied to you only via misleading affidavit and **omitted witness statements**.
- DA never addressed **Wong Sun**, **Franks**, or **Brady** in their reply.
- No chain of custody. No forensic link. No independent source doctrine invoked.

> _“Dismissal is warranted. The DA never cured the taint, never rebutted the omissions, and never validated the physical evidence. This is a poisoned case from warrant to trial.”_

---

### 4. **Brady + Franks Grounds = Structural Misconduct**
- Two key exculpatory witnesses (Davis & Paradise) were:
  - Never investigated
  - Suppressed from discovery
  - Now **subpoenaed and willing to testify** that no threat or gun was present
- This undermines **probable cause**, **charging documents**, and **warrant affidavits**.

> _“This case was constructed on selective omission. The prosecution shaped its facts, suppressed contradictions, and relied on fabrication.”_

---

### 5. **Emergency Motion to Compel: You Need Rulings Before Trial**
- The Court has failed to rule on:
  - Davis affidavit admission
  - Witness subpoena enforcement
  - Over 20 outstanding pretrial motions
- Demand immediate rulings **before jury selection**. Otherwise, raise **due process violation** under _Crane v. Kentucky_ and _Goldberg v. Kelly_.

> _“Trial cannot proceed where witness access, evidence admissibility, and core defenses remain in limbo.”_

## 🧷 Johnny’s Recommendation: Structure Your Hearing Argument

Here’s your **tight outline** for oral argument:

---

**“Your Honor, I respectfully request the following rulings before trial can proceed...”**

1. **Rule on each unrebutted motion** as waived under Rule 8.54(c)  
2. **Enforce CCP §170.6** and reassign the case  
3. **Dismiss charges stemming from tainted search and false affidavit**  
4. **Admit Emmanuel Davis’s sworn affidavit as Brady material**  
5. **Compel Davis’s live testimony or grant continuance under CCP §1987.1**  
6. **Issue written findings per CCP §632 and PC §1538.5(i)**  
7. **Sanction the People under PC §1054.5 for suppression and delay**

---

## 🧠 Bonus Trial-Readiness Move

**If the judge tries to punt rulings to trial** — object. Demand written denial or continuance:

> _“Without evidentiary rulings and Brady enforcement, any trial would proceed under structural prejudice. I must object on the record and preserve my right to seek extraordinary writ or habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. §2254.”_
