## ✅ Explicit Revised Pre-Trial Action Plan

### I. Immediate Pre-Trial Motions

#### A. **Motion to Dismiss - Filed Already (Brady Violations & PC §995)**

- Explicitly emphasize suppression of exculpatory evidence (Emmanuel Davis affidavit and Melissa Paradise anticipated testimony) in my Opposition Briefs.
- Clearly argue the omission of critical witness statements materially prejudiced the defense in my Opposition Briefs.

#### B. **Motion to Suppress Evidence - Filed Already (Franks v. Delaware also filed a Motion to Suppress per PC 1538.5)**

- Explicitly detail false or recklessly omitted information in the warrant affidavit regarding firearm allegations in my Opposition Briefs.
- Clearly highlight contradictions between initial police reports and subsequent statements by Davis and Paradise in my Opposition Briefs.

#### C. **Motion in Limine to Exclude Firearm Evidence (December 4)**

- Clearly state lack of relevance between firearm recovery on December 4 and allegations from November 13.
- Explicitly argue prejudicial impact under Evidence Code §352.
- Clearly document compromised chain of custody in violation of Evidence Code §§1400-1402.

#### D. **Motion to Compel Evidentiary Ruling on Defense Witnesses**

- Explicitly demand immediate rulings on admissibility of testimony from Davis and Paradise.
- Clearly assert violation of Sixth Amendment confrontation rights if testimony is denied.

#### E. **Motion to Continue Trial (Without Waiving Time)**

- Explicitly cite delayed disclosure of discovery (Brady violations) as significantly prejudicing the right to adequate preparation.

### II. Opposition Briefs Strategy

**Prepare three explicit Opposition Briefs tailored to the following possible DA responses:**

#### Version 1: **DA Files No Response**

- Explicitly document DA's failure to oppose, clearly citing default under Rule 8.54(c).
- Clearly assert the motions must be granted by default due to DA’s non-response.

#### Version 2: **DA Files Late or Generic Opposition**

- Clearly file Opposition explicitly objecting to late filing under Rule 8.54(c).
- Explicitly highlight DA's lack of substantive rebuttal to critical exculpatory evidence and discovery violations.

#### Version 3: **DA Files Substantive Opposition**

- Explicitly counter DA’s claims by clearly highlighting contradictions and suppressed exculpatory evidence (Davis and Paradise).
- Clearly reaffirm Brady and Franks violations and explicitly request judicial findings.

#### Opposition to DA Motion for Protective Order (Critical)\*\*

- Explicitly argue that the DA’s protective order motion seeks improper suppression of exculpatory evidence and defense witness testimony.
- Clearly highlight violation of constitutional due process rights.
- Explicitly request denial of protective order to ensure fair trial and defense rights.

### III. Critical Evidentiary Arguments

#### A. **Brady Violation:**

- Explicitly document intentional suppression of Davis and Paradise statements, clearly constituting Brady violations.

#### B. **Franks Violation (False Warrant Affidavit):**

- Clearly document misleading omissions and explicit contradictions in the warrant affidavit from Davis and Paradise statements.

#### C. **Chain of Custody Issues:**

### IV. Strategic Oral Arguments (April 8 Hearing)

- Explicitly emphasize prosecutorial misconduct in conflating unrelated incidents.
- Clearly articulate constitutional violations from suppressed evidence and compromised evidence handling.
- Explicitly request written judicial findings to preserve appellate rights.

### V. Witness Subpoena Strategy

- Explicitly subpoena Emmanuel Davis, Melissa Paradise, and investigating officers (Acosta, Ospina, Gomez) for critical testimony.
- Clearly document explicit contradictions by Davis and Paradise for immediate inclusion in court records.

### VI. Preservation of Appellate Rights

- Explicitly document each objection, ruling, and judicial decision to ensure robust appellate records.
- Clearly maintain written records of prosecutorial and investigative misconduct explicitly for appeal.

### VII. Immediate Action Steps (Today)

- Clearly prepare the three tailored Opposition Briefs based on possible DA responses.
- Explicitly prepare and file critical Opposition to DA Motion for Protective Order.
- Clearly document objections and rulings explicitly for appeal, ensuring procedural accuracy.
