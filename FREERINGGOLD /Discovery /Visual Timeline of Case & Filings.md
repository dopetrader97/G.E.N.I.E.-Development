Here is your **Visual Timeline Chart** for the case:

- It maps out all major discovery events, legal filings, suppression evidence, and procedural violations.
- You can use this to clearly show how the **State delayed discovery**, **buried exculpatory witnesses**, and tried to **run out the clock while violating due process**.
- This chart becomes powerful in motions, hearings, and especially appellate filings or federal habeas relief.

Let me know if you'd like this exported as a PDF or image, or if you want to overlay AT&T call data vs. incident time next.
