##: Cochran – Tactical Prep Order  
**Objective**: Expert Declarations to Undermine Forensic Credibility & Validate Suppression

---

### 🔬 1. **Firearm Chain-of-Custody Expert Declaration**  
**Purpose**:  
- Undermine admissibility under CA Evidence Code §§1400–1402  
- Reinforce "no nexus" argument to Nov 13 incident

**Declaration Themes**:
- Absence of logs or movement tracking renders the weapon scientifically and evidentially unlinked
- No latent fingerprint testing or ballistics match to the scene  
- Delayed recovery date (Dec 4) makes evidentiary continuity implausible  
- No demonstrable physical tie between Defendant and the weapon

**Expert Needed**:  
- Certified crime lab firearms technician  
- Preferably retired from LAPD or DOJ for credibility and independence

---

### 🔍 2. **Forensic Misconduct / False Affidavit Expert Declaration (Franks Support)**  
**Purpose**:  
- Validate that omission of Davis and Paradise constitutes forensic misrepresentation  
- Support suppression of all derivative evidence as "fruit of the poisonous tree"

**Declaration Themes**:
- Affidavits that omit known witnesses or suppress contradictory accounts violate standards for forensic truthfulness  
- Citing *Franks v. Delaware* and *People v. Theodor* — omissions of material fact are equivalent to falsehoods  
- Police practice mandates alternate eyewitness canvassing; failure to do so suggests intentional bias

**Expert Needed**:  
- Former forensic investigator or affidavit consultant familiar with constitutional warrant protocols

---

### 🧠 3. **Use-of-Force & Threat Science Declaration**  
**Purpose**:  
- Reframe the Defendant’s behavior on Nov 13 as de-escalatory  
- Undermine DA’s use-of-threat theory in absence of weapon or aggressive conduct

**Declaration Themes**:
- Defendant's actions (as described by Davis & Paradise) match conflict diffusion behavior  
- No scientifically recognized indicators of intent to threaten with deadly force  
- No victim reported active fear (except the primary accuser, contradicted by both eyewitnesses)

**Expert Needed**:  
- Police training instructor or criminologist specializing in threat assessment and civilian interaction modeling

---

### 🛠️ Next Steps:

- Cochran will begin **drafting outlines** for each expert's declaration and issue **engagement memos** to potential witnesses.
- Ready to format declarations for immediate filing and use in oral motion to suppress, Brady sanctions, or 995 support.
- Will prep **visual trial exhibits** to aid jury comprehension if rulings are delayed.

### 🧠 STRATEGY FOR OPENING STATEMENT TO COURT

> _“Your Honor, this case is not founded on evidence — it’s founded on omissions. Witnesses were suppressed. Affidavits were falsified. The firearm lacks a forensic or evidentiary link. The prosecution has defaulted on the record — and yet this court has not ruled on any of it. Today, we ask the court to enforce the law, protect due process, and refuse to be used as a tool of manipulation.”_

### 🧾 EVIDENTIARY ORDER OF PROOF (Recommended Flow)

1. **Narrative Declaration (Your Statement)** – Establish foundational context
2. **Call: Emmanuel Davis** – Start with strongest Franks/Brady testimony
3. **Call: Melissa Paradise** – Show suppression, contradict key accusation
4. **Call: Danny Fitzgerald** – Debunk narrative using tech + testimony
5. **Cross: Det. Hall-Fein** – Strike at warrant with Franks angle
6. **Cross: Custody Officer** – Knock out the firearm via chain failure
7. **Cross: Ex Patria Hardy** – End with narrative collapse
