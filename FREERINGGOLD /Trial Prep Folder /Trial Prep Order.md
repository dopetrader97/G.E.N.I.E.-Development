##: Cochran ‚Äì Tactical Prep Order  
**Objective**: Expert Declarations to Undermine Forensic Credibility & Validate Suppression

---

### üî¨ 1. **Firearm Chain-of-Custody Expert Declaration**  
**Purpose**:  
- Undermine admissibility under CA Evidence Code ¬ß¬ß1400‚Äì1402  
- Reinforce "no nexus" argument to Nov 13 incident

**Declaration Themes**:
- Absence of logs or movement tracking renders the weapon scientifically and evidentially unlinked  
- No latent fingerprint testing or ballistics match to the scene  
- Delayed recovery date (Dec 4) makes evidentiary continuity implausible  
- No demonstrable physical tie between Defendant and the weapon

**Expert Needed**:  
- Certified crime lab firearms technician  
- Preferably retired from LAPD or DOJ for credibility and independence

---

### üîç 2. **Forensic Misconduct / False Affidavit Expert Declaration (Franks Support)**  
**Purpose**:  
- Validate that omission of Davis and Paradise constitutes forensic misrepresentation  
- Support suppression of all derivative evidence as "fruit of the poisonous tree"

**Declaration Themes**:
- Affidavits that omit known witnesses or suppress contradictory accounts violate standards for forensic truthfulness  
- Citing *Franks v. Delaware* and *People v. Theodor* ‚Äî omissions of material fact are equivalent to falsehoods  
- Police practice mandates alternate eyewitness canvassing; failure to do so suggests intentional bias

**Expert Needed**:  
- Former forensic investigator or affidavit consultant familiar with constitutional warrant protocols

---

### üß† 3. **Use-of-Force & Threat Science Declaration**  
**Purpose**:  
- Reframe the Defendant‚Äôs behavior on Nov 13 as de-escalatory  
- Undermine DA‚Äôs use-of-threat theory in absence of weapon or aggressive conduct

**Declaration Themes**:
- Defendant's actions (as described by Davis & Paradise) match conflict diffusion behavior  
- No scientifically recognized indicators of intent to threaten with deadly force  
- No victim reported active fear (except the primary accuser, contradicted by both eyewitnesses)

**Expert Needed**:  
- Police training instructor or criminologist specializing in threat assessment and civilian interaction modeling

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps:

- Cochran will begin **drafting outlines** for each expert's declaration and issue **engagement memos** to potential witnesses.
- Ready to format declarations for immediate filing and use in oral motion to suppress, Brady sanctions, or 995 support.
- Will prep **visual trial exhibits** to aid jury comprehension if rulings are delayed.

Bailey, you want Cochran to finalize these drafts and route them to Johnny for delivery, or prep them for emergency oral submission in court tomorrow?

Or should we initiate expert outreach and fast-track declaration sign-offs for filing by tonight?

Your call ‚Äî we‚Äôre locked in.
