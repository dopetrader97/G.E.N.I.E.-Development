**Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,**

My name is Reginald Buddy Ringgold III, and I have the honor of representing myself in this case. But more than that, I have the responsibility — to tell you the truth about what happened, and to expose what didn’t.

This case is not what it seems. It’s not about danger. It’s not about violence. It’s about betrayal — and how one lie, told at the right time, can turn into a legal avalanche.

You will hear about a woman named **Ex Patria Hardy**. I knew her. I trusted her. I loved her. She was my fiancée. Not just a tenant, not just a witness — she was someone I was building a life with. I paid for the home we lived in. I gave her access to everything: the house, the car, the relationship.

But once she got what she wanted — once her name was on the lease — things changed. The communication stopped. The connection ended. The warmth disappeared. What followed wasn’t just emotional distance. It was a plan. A quiet, calculated strategy to remove me from my own home.

You’ll learn how the locks were changed on me. How my personal property started disappearing. How the house I paid for was turned into a party zone. And when I stepped back — when I left to get space and regroup — I returned at the **request of the landlord**, to check on the condition of the property.

And that’s when I walked in and found **Ex Patria Hardy in bed with another man**. Not just any man — a known actor, Robert Ri’chard. In my home. Wearing my clothes. Sleeping in the bed I paid for.

And what did she do?

She panicked. Not because she was afraid — but because she was exposed. Within 24 hours, she filed a **restraining order**. Not to protect herself, but to protect her narrative. That restraining order — based on a false claim of a gun and a threat — gave her the power to stay in the mansion rent-free and push me completely out of the life I had built.

You’ll hear the DA say this case is about a gun. But there was no gun. You’ll hear them say there was a threat. But **there was no threat**. Not according to the two people who were actually there: **Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise**.

Emmanuel Davis was listed as a victim in the original complaint — but he never spoke to police. He never testified. And when I finally reached him, he gave me a sworn statement that **he never saw a weapon, never heard a threat, and saw me trying to calm things down**.

Melissa Paradise was allegedly one of the people I “threatened.” She was there. She saw everything. She has since told law enforcement, on record, that **I never threatened her and she never saw a gun**. She’ll be here to testify to that — not because she’s on my side, but because **it’s the truth**.

You’ll hear how the police never even tried to speak to them. You’ll learn how the search warrant they used to build this case was **based on half-truths, false claims, and a manipulated affidavit** that excluded Davis and Paradise entirely.

You’ll also learn that the car they claim ties me to the weapon **was never mine**. The actual owner, **Antwaun Brown**, is a Las Vegas resident who has come forward to testify. The car was his. I wasn’t on the insurance. I wasn’t the registered owner. And yet — the police never contacted him. Not once.

Ladies and gentlemen, this case was **built on assumptions, not facts**. On omissions, not evidence. And when I tried to raise these issues — when I filed more than **30 lawful motions**, following every rule — the court denied them. Not because they lacked merit, but because the system isn't designed for someone like me to represent themselves and win.

But that’s why you’re here. Because no matter what happened in the paperwork, **truth still lives in this courtroom**. And the truth is, this isn’t a case about crime. It’s a case about **control**. About a false accusation made to protect a lie. About a man who caught his fiancée cheating — and then had his life dismantled by the fallout.

There is no weapon. There is no threat. There is no crime.  
There is only a story — told to law enforcement, crafted to preserve a lifestyle, and allowed to grow without scrutiny.

Now, for the first time, the other side gets to be heard.  
And when this trial ends — I believe you’ll see what really happened.  
And you’ll return the only verdict justice can support: **Not Guilty**.

Thank you.
