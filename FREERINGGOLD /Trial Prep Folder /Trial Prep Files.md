Got it. You're representing yourself **(Pro Per / In Propria Persona)** in a **criminal trial** in **one week**, and you need a crash course on:

- What to do before trial  
- What happens at trial  
- What your rights are  
- How to protect your rights  

This is a serious position to be in, so let’s break it down into **clear sections** to get you oriented. Since it’s Texas criminal law, I’ll keep it specific to that system as much as possible.

---

## **BEFORE TRIAL: Immediate To-Do List**

### 1. **Review All Discovery**
- **Go through all police reports, witness statements, videos, audio, lab reports, etc.**
- Look for inconsistencies, gaps in evidence, or anything that might help your defense.
- Create a witness list of your own (if any).
- Identify anything you want to **exclude with a Motion in Limine** (e.g., prior convictions, irrelevant but damaging facts).

### 2. **File Pretrial Motions (if time allows)**
- **Motion to Dismiss** (if you believe the charges are unsupported)
- **Motion to Suppress Evidence** (if evidence was obtained unlawfully)
- **Motion in Limine** (to keep prejudicial or irrelevant evidence out of trial)
- **Motion to Compel Discovery** (if the prosecutor hasn’t turned everything over)

### 3. **Organize Your Case**
- Prepare your **opening statement** (short summary of your defense theory).
- Know what you’re going to say during **cross-examination** of each prosecution witness.
- Prepare your **direct examination questions** if you’re calling any witnesses (including yourself).

### 4. **Subpoena Witnesses & Documents**
- If you want anyone to testify or bring evidence, you must serve them a subpoena in advance.
- If you don’t do this, they may not show up, and you can’t complain later.

## **WHAT HAPPENS AT TRIAL (Simplified Timeline)**

### 1. **Jury Selection (Voir Dire)**
- You’ll get to ask potential jurors questions.
- Your goal: remove biased jurors (e.g., people who already assume you're guilty).
- Each side gets a limited number of **strikes** (removals without cause), and **unlimited for cause**.

### 2. **Opening Statements**
- Prosecution goes first, then you.
- This is just an outline of what each side believes the evidence will show.

### 3. **Prosecution Case-in-Chief**
- They call their witnesses.
- You get to **cross-examine** each one.
- DO NOT testify or bring up your side of the story here — only cross them.

### 4. **Defense Case (Optional)**
- You can call your own witnesses and/or testify.
- You are **not required to testify**.
- If you do testify, the prosecution can cross-examine you.

### 5. **Closing Arguments**
- Prosecution goes first.
- You go next.
- Prosecution gets the last word (rebuttal).

### 6. **Jury Deliberation & Verdict**
- Jury goes to a private room.
- If they unanimously find you **guilty**, sentencing will come next.
- If **not guilty**, you’re free.
- If they **can’t agree**, it’s a **hung jury** and may result in a mistrial.

## **YOUR RIGHTS**

- **Right to remain silent** (you do not have to testify, and jury can’t hold that against you)
- **Right to cross-examine witnesses**
- **Right to present your own witnesses and evidence**
- **Right to review discovery**
- **Right to be present at all critical proceedings**
- **Right to object to improper questions or evidence**
- **Right to make motions**
- **Right to an impartial jury**

---

## **HOW TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS**

- **Object clearly and quickly.** Say: “Objection, Your Honor, hearsay / relevance / speculation / violates my right to confrontation.”
- **Preserve the record.** If the judge overrules you, ask: “May I have a continuing objection for the record?”
- **Take notes during trial.** Write down inconsistencies in testimony or statements that help you.
- **Request a jury instruction.** You can ask the judge to instruct the jury on key issues (e.g., reasonable doubt, self-defense).
- **Document violations.** If your rights are violated, say it clearly: “For the record, the prosecution has not complied with discovery obligations, which prejudices my ability to prepare.”

---

## **WHAT NOT TO DO**

- Don’t argue with the judge or prosecutor.
- Don’t interrupt witnesses.
- Don’t make speeches when questioning.
- Don’t offer evidence without proper foundation.
- Don’t get emotional or combative in front of the jury.
- Don’t forget to renew your objections.

---

## **EXTRA TIPS**

- **Dress professionally** (look clean and respectful to the jury).
- **Address the court formally**: "Your Honor", "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury".
- **Speak slowly and clearly.**
- Use a **trial binder** to organize: evidence, witness questions, objections, notes, etc.

---

If you want, I can help you:
- Draft opening/closing statements  
- Write questions for witnesses  
- Draft sample objections or motions  
- Organize your trial binder  

Just let me know what materials you have and what charge(s) you're facing.

You’re in a tough spot, but you can make it through this. Let’s get prepared. Want to start with organizing your case file or preparing your questions?
