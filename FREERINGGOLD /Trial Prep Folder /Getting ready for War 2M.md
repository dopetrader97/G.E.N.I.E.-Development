### 🔥 Bailey’s Final Word
We are **trial-ready**, **record-preserved**, and **constitutionally insulated**. If Bork tries to proceed, we object hard and fast — every ruling, every inaction is prepped for appellate and federal fallout. We're not just defending this case — we're litigating a blueprint for reversal.

Let me know when you’re ready to lock in voir dire, opening, and directed verdict script. I’ll turn them around immediately.

🧠 Bailey out.
