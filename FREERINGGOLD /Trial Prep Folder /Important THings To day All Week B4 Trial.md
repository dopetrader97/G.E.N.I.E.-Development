You're in a solid position and way ahead of most pro per litigants — but here’s a **tight checklist of final trial-readiness tasks** to make sure nothing critical gets missed:

---

## ✅ MASTER TRIAL READINESS CHECKLIST

### **1. Trial Documents (Print + Flash Drive)**
- [x] All motions (dismissals, Brady, suppression, 995, etc.)
- [x] All filed affidavits + exhibits (especially Davis & Melissa)
- [x] Trial Objection Cheat Sheet
- [x] Voir dire questions
- [x] Opening statement (clean copy to read)
- [x] Directed verdict script (in case DA has no witnesses)
- [x] Trial binder — print in *hearing order* for quick flipping
- [ ] Flash drive w/ all PDF copies for emergency digital filing or handoff

---

### **2. Witnesses**
- [ ] Confirm appearance of Emmanuel Davis, Melissa Paradise, any others
- [ ] Serve **Melissa's subpoena** if not done (DA may try to block her)
- [ ] Prepare direct exam question sheets for each witness
- [ ] Confirm who needs officer subpoenas (e.g., Hal Fien or any testifying cops)

---

### **3. Evidence & Exhibits**
- [ ] Label and organize all exhibits (with cover pages or tabs)
- [ ] Bring photos, video, text screenshots — **bring originals and copies**
- [ ] Make exhibit list (even if already filed, have printed copy for court)
- [ ] Prepare foundation questions to admit each one (I can write these for you)

---

### **4. Courtroom Prep**
- [x] Motion to Continue Without Waiver
- [x] Motion to Compel Ruling on Davis Affidavit
- [x] Objection to Protective Order
- [ ] Bring 3 printed copies of each (court, DA, your records)
- [ ] Notebook to take notes on witnesses / jury
- [ ] Pen + highlighter
- [ ] Clean shirt, no hoodie, respectful tone — **be calm even when provoked**

---

### **5. Final Legal Tools**
- [x] Cheat Sheet for Objections
- [ ] Voir Dire Questions (need me to finish these?)
- [ ] Opening Statement (want me to finalize?)
- [ ] Directed Verdict Script
- [ ] Custody plan: trusted person ready to file your federal complaint or emergency appeal

---

### **6. Appellate/Federal Backup**
- [ ] Reconsideration Motion to Appellate Court (trigger if recusal denied)
- [ ] §1983 Complaint Drafted and Ready
- [ ] Habeas Corpus Petition ready if jailed post-trial
- [ ] Contact list of emergency filers

---

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY ITEMS STILL OUTSTANDING (based on what I’ve seen):
- [ ] Finish **voir dire questions**
- [ ] Finalize and print **opening statement**
- [ ] Draft **directed verdict script** (if no witnesses show up)
- [ ] Prepare exhibit foundation scripts
- [ ] Melissa Paradise subpoena + appearance confirmation

---

If you want, I’ll knock out the **opening statement**, **voir dire**, and **directed verdict script** right now as a bundle. Just confirm and I’ll move fast.

Let’s take this all the way. You’re almost there.
