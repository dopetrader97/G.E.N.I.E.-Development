Thanks for uploading everything — I reviewed your **Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate**, your declarations, and the related filings (CCP §170.6 motion, motion to dismiss for judicial bias, and supporting declarations). Here's a detailed assessment based solely on the **California Rules of Court, Title 8 (Appellate Rules)**, and what can be done to strengthen your position if needed:

---

### ✅ **Strengths in Your Writ Petition**

1. **Grounds for Relief Are Clearly Articulated**  
   The petition identifies four central legal errors:
   - Violation of **CCP §170.6**: Judge Bork ruled after a disqualification motion.
   - Refusal to rule on **23 pending motions**.
   - Denial of written findings as required under **CCP §632** and **Penal Code §1538.5(i)**.
   - Procedural disparity in time granted to the prosecution vs. defense.

2. **Supporting Record Is Robust**  
   You've submitted multiple declarations under penalty of perjury detailing the procedural misconduct. These are critical for mandamus relief.

3. **Proper Citation to Authority**  
   You correctly cite relevant authority like *Peracchi v. Superior Court*, *People v. Lavi*, and constitutional due process decisions. The CRC-based argument under Rule 8.54(c) for procedural default is also sound.

4. **Emergency Relief Framing**  
   Requesting a **stay of trial** and assignment to a neutral judge aligns with the purpose of an **extraordinary writ** under CRC 8.452.

### ⚖️ **Procedural Conformity With the CRC (Areas to Watch)**

#### 1. **Correct Governing Rule: Rule 8.452**
You correctly file this as a **petition for writ of mandate** in the Court of Appeal and cite **CRC Rule 8.452**. That rule governs **writs in criminal proceedings** (for pretrial rulings, disqualifications, and discovery issues). Your format substantially complies.

> 📌 **Make sure** the proof of service complies with **Rule 8.25(b)** (service on trial court judge, opposing party, and superior court clerk).

#### 2. **Support by Record or Exhibits**  
Under **Rule 8.486(b)(1)**, your petition must be supported by:
- A **verified petition** (you have this),
- **Exhibits or a supporting record**, including relevant trial court documents (e.g., the §170.6 motion, pending motions, any hearing transcripts, and court orders or minute entries).

> 🔧 **Suggestion:** If any **minute orders** or **transcripts** exist confirming the court denied motions post–§170.6, include them directly as exhibits to comply fully with CRC 8.486(b)(1).

#### 3. **Request for Stay**
You're seeking a **stay of trial**, which is permissible under **CRC 8.116**. The request is included in your prayer, but consider filing a **standalone application for stay** under **Rule 8.116** to isolate the request and prompt immediate review.

### 🛠️ HOW TO STRENGTHEN IF NOT GRANTED

If the writ is **not granted**, here are a few strategic moves:

#### 🔹 1. File a Standalone Application for Stay  
Under **CRC 8.116(b)**, you can file a stay application even if your writ petition is pending. Include:
- A concise statement of urgency (i.e., trial scheduled for April 9, 2025),
- A declaration regarding irreparable harm if the stay is denied,
- A copy of the trial court’s adverse rulings.

#### 🔹 2. Augment or Correct the Record  
If the appellate court issues a deficiency notice (e.g., missing orders or rulings), use **CRC 8.155(a)** to **augment the record**. You may request that the superior court **prepare transcripts** or **settle a statement** if no written order exists.

#### 🔹 3. Refile or Seek Reconsideration  
If your writ is denied **summarily**, and new evidence or orders arise post-denial, you can seek **reconsideration** or file a **renewed petition** under **CRC 8.264(b)(1)** if based on changed circumstances or newly discovered facts.

---

### 🚫 Be Aware

- The **CRC does not provide** for reply briefs in writ petitions **unless requested by the Court** (Cal. R. Ct. 8.487(a)(2)).
- If you are filing multiple declarations or supplements, ensure they are **consolidated** or clearly labeled to avoid confusion and potential rejection under **Rule 8.486(c)** (format and length limits).

### 📋 Summary Checklist

| Action Item | Rule | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Verified petition for writ of mandate | CRC 8.452 | ✅ |
| Cited legal basis for disqualification | CCP §170.6; Peracchi | ✅ |
| Sought stay of trial | CRC 8.116 | ✅ (included, consider standalone app) |
| Supporting record attached | CRC 8.486(b)(1) | 🔶 (add minute orders/transcripts if available) |
| Proof of service | CRC 8.25 | 🔶 (ensure it's served on judge, clerk, DA) |

Thanks for the detailed background and for uploading the full set of materials. Based solely on the **California Rules of Court, Title 8 (Appellate Rules)** and the First District's local authorities, here's a tailored follow-up assessment of your **Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate**—now with specific attention to:

- The judicial ruling post–CCP §170.6 motion,
- The DA’s Omnibus Opposition,
- Procedural posture,
- And completeness of record support.

---

### ✅ **New Confirmation of Key Facts and Procedural Support**

Your position is materially reinforced by the DA’s own filing:

#### 🔹 **Post–§170.6 Rulings by Judge Bork Are Confirmed**
The **People's Omnibus Opposition** explicitly states that on **March 24, 2025**, the court “_summarily struck a number of motions_” and then ordered the People to respond to others filed after you gained pro per status on **February 11, 2025**.

> ✅ This confirms that Judge Bork **ruled on substantive matters after the filing of your CCP §170.6 motion**, which—if timely and compliant—renders **all subsequent rulings void** under *Peracchi v. Superior Court* (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1245.

This is now a **factual cornerstone** for writ relief, and one the Court of Appeal must confront directly.

---

### 🔍 **Additional Procedural Enhancements Based on the CRC**

Here are the new key points that can be leveraged or addressed to further **strengthen your procedural posture**:

---

#### 🔹 **Rule 8.25(b) – Required Proof of Service**
All petitions, motions, and declarations must include **proof of service** on:

- The trial judge (Judge Bork),
- The superior court clerk,
- The opposing party (District Attorney).

> If not already attached, **promptly file a conforming proof of service** to eliminate this as a basis for summary denial. (Cal. R. Ct. 8.25(b).)

---

#### 🔹 **Rule 8.486(b)(1) – Adequate Record Support**
You’ve satisfied most components of CRC 8.486(b)(1), which requires:
- A **verified petition** ✅
- Copies of **supporting declarations and motions** ✅
- Relevant orders or **minute entries** that show Judge Bork ruled post–disqualification ❗️

> 🛠️ **Recommendation**: Include a **certified copy of the minute order** from March 24, 2025 or **highlight the DA’s concession** in their Omnibus Opposition to substitute where no formal minute order exists. This satisfies CRC 8.486(b)(1) in practice.

---

#### 🔹 **Rule 8.116 – Standalone Application for Stay**
Although your petition prays for a stay, **Rule 8.116(b)** authorizes a **standalone “application for stay”** to prompt quicker action.

> ⚖️ Consider filing one now. Attach your supplemental declaration and argue **irreparable harm due to trial's imminence (April 9)** and the pending disqualification dispute.

---

#### 🔹 **Rule 8.54(c) – Failure to Oppose Motions**
You are correct to invoke **CRC 8.54(c)**. While not mandatory, the rule does allow the Court of Appeal to treat **unopposed motions as admitted or consented to**.

> And given the DA waited **51 days** to file any response—long beyond a standard 10-day reply window—you may argue **prejudice from judicial inaction** and procedural favoritism.

---

### 📍Conclusion & Strategic Notes

You’ve satisfied the formal requirements of CRC 8.452 and 8.486, and the **DA’s own filing confirms your factual claim** that the judge ruled post–§170.6. Procedurally, the Court of Appeal must now consider the legal void that follows such a ruling under **Peracchi**.

To strengthen your record:
- File or attach any available **minute order** or transcript from **March 24, 2025** (or cite the Omnibus Opposition clearly),
- Submit a **standalone application for stay under Rule 8.116**, and
- Ensure all filings include full **proof of service per Rule 8.25(b)**.

If the petition is summarily denied, consider a **motion for reconsideration under Rule 8.264(b)(1)** based on post-denial developments, and preserve the federal issues for habeas if necessary.

Let me know if you want a template or filing checklist for the standalone stay application.
