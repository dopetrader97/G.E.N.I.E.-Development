Thanks for uploading everything — I reviewed your **Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate**, your declarations, and the related filings (CCP §170.6 motion, motion to dismiss for judicial bias, and supporting declarations). Here's a detailed assessment based solely on the **California Rules of Court, Title 8 (Appellate Rules)**, and what can be done to strengthen your position if needed:

---

### ✅ **Strengths in Your Writ Petition**

1. **Grounds for Relief Are Clearly Articulated**  
   The petition identifies four central legal errors:
   - Violation of **CCP §170.6**: Judge Bork ruled after a disqualification motion.
   - Refusal to rule on **23 pending motions**.
   - Denial of written findings as required under **CCP §632** and **Penal Code §1538.5(i)**.
   - Procedural disparity in time granted to the prosecution vs. defense.

2. **Supporting Record Is Robust**  
   You've submitted multiple declarations under penalty of perjury detailing the procedural misconduct. These are critical for mandamus relief.

3. **Proper Citation to Authority**  
   You correctly cite relevant authority like *Peracchi v. Superior Court*, *People v. Lavi*, and constitutional due process decisions. The CRC-based argument under Rule 8.54(c) for procedural default is also sound.

4. **Emergency Relief Framing**  
   Requesting a **stay of trial** and assignment to a neutral judge aligns with the purpose of an **extraordinary writ** under CRC 8.452.

### ⚖️ **Procedural Conformity With the CRC (Areas to Watch)**

#### 1. **Correct Governing Rule: Rule 8.452**
You correctly file this as a **petition for writ of mandate** in the Court of Appeal and cite **CRC Rule 8.452**. That rule governs **writs in criminal proceedings** (for pretrial rulings, disqualifications, and discovery issues). Your format substantially complies.

> 📌 **Make sure** the proof of service complies with **Rule 8.25(b)** (service on trial court judge, opposing party, and superior court clerk).

#### 2. **Support by Record or Exhibits**  
Under **Rule 8.486(b)(1)**, your petition must be supported by:
- A **verified petition** (you have this),
- **Exhibits or a supporting record**, including relevant trial court documents (e.g., the §170.6 motion, pending motions, any hearing transcripts, and court orders or minute entries).

> 🔧 **Suggestion:** If any **minute orders** or **transcripts** exist confirming the court denied motions post–§170.6, include them directly as exhibits to comply fully with CRC 8.486(b)(1).

#### 3. **Request for Stay**
You're seeking a **stay of trial**, which is permissible under **CRC 8.116**. The request is included in your prayer, but consider filing a **standalone application for stay** under **Rule 8.116** to isolate the request and prompt immediate review.

### 🛠️ HOW TO STRENGTHEN IF NOT GRANTED

If the writ is **not granted**, here are a few strategic moves:

#### 🔹 1. File a Standalone Application for Stay  
Under **CRC 8.116(b)**, you can file a stay application even if your writ petition is pending. Include:
- A concise statement of urgency (i.e., trial scheduled for April 9, 2025),
- A declaration regarding irreparable harm if the stay is denied,
- A copy of the trial court’s adverse rulings.

#### 🔹 2. Augment or Correct the Record  
If the appellate court issues a deficiency notice (e.g., missing orders or rulings), use **CRC 8.155(a)** to **augment the record**. You may request that the superior court **prepare transcripts** or **settle a statement** if no written order exists.

#### 🔹 3. Refile or Seek Reconsideration  
If your writ is denied **summarily**, and new evidence or orders arise post-denial, you can seek **reconsideration** or file a **renewed petition** under **CRC 8.264(b)(1)** if based on changed circumstances or newly discovered facts.

### 🚫 Be Aware

- The **CRC does not provide** for reply briefs in writ petitions **unless requested by the Court** (Cal. R. Ct. 8.487(a)(2)).
- If you are filing multiple declarations or supplements, ensure they are **consolidated** or clearly labeled to avoid confusion and potential rejection under **Rule 8.486(c)** (format and length limits).
