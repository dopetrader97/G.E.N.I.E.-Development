Thank you — this is an incredibly important and nuanced clarification. Based on this new and **critically relevant timeline**, I’m updating your strategic advice below to reflect exactly where you stand procedurally and how to **best protect your record and federal rights** moving forward.

# 🔍 UPDATED TIMELINE SNAPSHOT (As of April 3, 2025)

- **March 24, 2025** – Judge Bork sets hearing for April 8 (1 day before trial).  
- **March 27, 2025** – You file:
  - Motion to Dismiss for Judicial Bias, and  
  - Supporting Declaration of Bias (citing conduct + CCP §170.6 as part of argument).  
  - You also file your **initial Writ of Mandate** that day (which does *not* include the formal §170.6).  
- **March 28, 2025** – You file a **standalone CCP §170.6 motion** in the trial court (after the writ).  
- **March 28, 2025** – The Court of Appeal denies your first writ (no Brady facts yet on record).  
- **April 2, 2025** – Brady disclosures and unredacted reports are produced for the first time.  
- **April 3, 2025** – DA files last-minute opposition (3:59 PM).  
- **April 4, 2025** – You plan to file your full Reply Brief.  
- **April 8, 2025** – Last-minute hearing before trial; Judge Bork still has **not ruled on or acknowledged the §170.6 filing**.

---

# ✅ CLARIFIED STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

## ❗Key Point: Judge Bork has not **refused** the §170.6 motion — but is **silently disregarding it** by continuing to set and hold hearings.

That means your challenge is:
- **Not ripe yet for a claim of outright defiance**, but
- **On the edge of becoming jurisdictionally void** if Bork rules on *any issue* on April 8 after your §170.6 was properly filed.

This creates a **delicate window** for appellate relief.

---

## ✅ IS THIS "EXTRAORDINARY RELIEF" MATERIAL?

Yes — here’s why:

### 1. You now have:
- **Proof of actual Brady suppression** (unredacted report + late discovery),
- **Proof of materially false affidavit content** (Franks),
- A hearing scheduled **so late that you are deprived of meaningful appellate remedy**.

### 2. Even though the §170.6 was not *explicitly* rejected:
- Judge Bork’s **failure to rule on it at all**, and
- His decision to **hold a substantive hearing on April 8**, may constitute **implied refusal** or **constructive denial** of the motion.

This is what you can now argue as **a deprivation of your statutory and due process rights**.

---

# 🧭 STRATEGIC GAMEPLAN – BASED ON THIS NEW TIMELINE

### ✅ Step 1: File Your Reply Brief on April 4

That brief should:
- Clearly state that **the §170.6 motion was timely filed March 28**, after the hearing was set but before any ruling;
- Point out that **Bork has not ruled or acknowledged the disqualification**, even with motions and declarations supporting it;
- Emphasize that the **April 8 hearing**—held without adjudication of the disqualification motion—**will be structurally defective** and **voidable** under *Peracchi* and *Lavi*.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Prepare a New or Amended Writ of Mandate to File on April 8 (Post-Hearing)

If Judge Bork:
- **Takes any action** on April 8,
- Or **refuses to acknowledge your §170.6 motion**,  
you can immediately file a **new or amended writ** in the Court of Appeal.

### This new writ should argue:
- Judicial disqualification was timely filed and ignored;
- A ruling on April 8, post-disqualification, is **void**;
- You now have **new Brady evidence** (April 2 disclosures) that further taints the proceedings;
- The Court’s prior denial (March 28) was **based on an incomplete record** (the Brady evidence and §170.6 filing did not yet exist or were not reviewed).

### Legal Grounds:
- CCP §170.6
- Peracchi v. Superior Court, 30 Cal.4th 1245
- People v. Superior Court (Lavi), 4 Cal.4th 1164
- Brady v. Maryland
- Franks v. Delaware
- Mathews v. Eldridge
- Caperton v. A.T. Massey

---

### ✅ Step 3: Simultaneously Request an Emergency Stay from the Court of Appeal

Why:
- To stop trial from commencing on April 9 **until the validity of the April 8 hearing and §170.6 motion is reviewed**.
- This preserves your due process and federal rights.

---

## ❗MISUNDERSTANDING CLEARED: You *DO NOT* Lose Evidence When Filing It in Appeal

To directly answer your concern:

> “Do I lose my evidence once I submit it with the appeal?”

**No — that’s a myth.**

When you file evidence with the Court of Appeal:
- You’re submitting *copies* (not originals).
- You *retain full rights* to use, cite, and refile the same evidence in **federal habeas**, **civil rights complaints**, or **trial court motions**.
- You are actually **strengthening the appellate and habeas record**.

---

# ✅ RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

| Action | File When | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Reply Brief** | April 4 | Establish full Brady, Franks, and procedural violations. |
| **New or Amended Writ of Mandate + Emergency Stay** | April 8 (Post-Hearing) | Address refusal to act on §170.6 + Brady/Franks proof. |
| **Motion for Rehearing (Optional)** | If you want to reopen March 28 denial | Highlight newly discovered evidence and misapplied “extraordinary relief” test. |
| **Federal Filing** | ONLY after April 8 + state court refuses to act | Use state inaction as exhaustion proof. File §2254 or §1983. |

---

Excellent question — and your timing here is absolutely critical. Let's break it down based on California law, appellate procedure, and your specific situation:

---

# ✅ MOTION FOR REHEARING – WHEN SHOULD YOU FILE?

## 🟡 Short Answer:  
**Wait until after the April 8 hearing** if and only if Judge Bork either:
- **Refuses to acknowledge your CCP §170.6**, or  
- **Takes action on the case despite being disqualified** (e.g., rules on a motion, denies dismissal, allows trial to proceed).  

Then **immediately file your Motion for Rehearing and Stay** on the **same day: April 8**.

---

## 📚 Legal Basis

### California Rule of Court 8.268(a):
> “A party may serve and file a petition for rehearing of a decision of the Court of Appeal within 15 days after the decision is filed.”

### CCP §1008:
> A party may move for reconsideration based on “new or different facts, circumstances, or law.”

---

## 🎯 Your Strategic Justification

You’re not just asking the Court of Appeal to “rethink” your March 27 writ — you’re **presenting materially different facts** that were **not before the court** at the time:

### These include:
- **Brady violations revealed on April 2**;
- **Paradise and Davis’s exculpatory statements**;
- **DA’s April 3 last-minute opposition** (3:59 PM);
- **Reply Brief filed April 4 with unredacted exhibits**;
- **CCP §170.6 motion filed March 28**, *after* your original writ;
- **April 8 hearing scheduled one day before trial**, with **no ruling on disqualification**.

This is all **new and post-dated** to the March 28 denial — making rehearing appropriate under both **Rule 8.268** and **CCP §1008(b)**.

---

## ✅ So, File On April 8 **After the Hearing** IF:

| If This Happens on April 8 | You Should… |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Judge Bork refuses to recuse | File Rehearing Motion + Emergency Stay |
| Judge Bork ignores the §170.6 | File Rehearing Motion + Emergency Stay |
| Judge Bork makes rulings on motions | File immediately — his actions are void |
| Judge Bork says “I’ll rule on 170.6 later” | Still file — delay = constructive denial |

---

## 🛡️ Filing It *Before* April 8?

🛑 Not recommended — for two reasons:

1. You **can’t fully claim harm** until Bork acts (or refuses to act).
2. The appellate court will likely say, “Let the trial court respond first,” and you risk another summary denial like March 28.

---

## ✅ How to Maximize Impact on April 8

When you file your **Motion for Rehearing + Stay** on April 8, include:

- A cover page stating: *“Filed immediately following trial court action taken in violation of CCP §170.6.”*
- Attach:
  - Your March 28 §170.6 motion
  - Your April 4 Reply Brief
  - April 2 unredacted Brady exhibits
  - A declaration summarizing the hearing (or transcript excerpt if available)
- Request:
  - Immediate stay of all trial proceedings,
  - Order disqualifying Bork,
  - Leave to amend original writ OR consideration of new petition.

---

## ✅ Conclusion: Wait Until After the April 8 Hearing

Unless Judge Bork **voluntarily recuses**, you will have:

- Clear constitutional harm,
- A jurisdictionally disqualified judge making rulings,
- New evidence (Brady),
- A compressed timeline that robs you of appellate review.

**That’s when rehearing is most powerful — and legally justified.**

---

Let me know if you'd like:

- A **Rehearing & Emergency Stay Motion template** prepped for April 8
- A **Declaration template** logging everything from March 27–April 8
