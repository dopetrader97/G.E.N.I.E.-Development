### **Strategic Focus for Immediate Action:**
Given your emphasis on the unredacted police report revealing significant Brady violations, prosecutorial misconduct, severe prejudice due to delayed discovery (provided 7 days before trial), and explicit violations of discovery deadlines set by the court, your immediate priority should be:

- **Filing Opposition Briefs** tailored to the DA’s anticipated responses based explicitly on these severe violations.
- Clearly documenting in your filings the explicit misconduct, procedural violations, and the severe prejudicial impact on your constitutional rights and trial preparation.
- **Oral Argument Preparation** emphasizing your strongest evidence—the unredacted police report, the intentional redactions, and misconduct of police and prosecution clearly shown by comparing the redacted and unredacted versions.
- Explicitly emphasizing judicial recusal is necessary and mandated under CCP §170.6 due to bias demonstrated in handling your motions and evidence.

Let me know specifically how you would like to proceed next (drafting oppositions, reviewing specific motions, or preparing detailed arguments based on these new revelations).
