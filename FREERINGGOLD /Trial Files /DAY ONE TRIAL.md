Locked in. Here's how we break this down for you:

## 🔑 **DAY ONE – What to Expect in Court (Jury Selection / Voir Dire)**

### 🎯 **Goals for Day One**
1. Select a fair and impartial jury.
2. Expose any bias (toward law enforcement, domestic violence, self-represented defendants).
3. Plant the theme: You are innocent, organized, and fighting with truth on your side.

### ✅ **What You’ll Likely Do:**
- Introduce yourself as your own attorney.
- Conduct voir dire (jury questioning).
- Challenge biased jurors “for cause.”
- Possibly make opening statements (sometimes done Day 2).

---

## 🎒 **What You NEED Day One**
- Your **voir dire questions** (print them + bring spares).
- Your **juror notepad** (label by seat number — write down red flags).
- Your **witness list** (in case asked about trial structure).
- Your **exhibit list** (to start prepping for foundation questions).
- Your **Trial Toolkit flow checklist** — keep it on the desk with you.

## 🧠 BONUS MOVE – First Impression Jury Introduction

> “Good morning. My name is Reginald Ringgold, and I am representing myself in this matter. You’ll hear a lot of things in this courtroom, but I ask only one thing — that you wait until you’ve heard all the evidence before making any judgment. Because once you do, you’ll see the truth. That I didn’t commit any of these charges. And that the people who know the truth will stand right here and tell it to you.”
