## 🔨 DIRECT EXAMINATION SCRIPT – ANTWUAN BROWN

### 🧱 *Foundation Questions (Chain of Possession + Ownership)*
> “Mr. Brown, do you currently own a vehicle registered in your name?”  
> “What kind of car is it?”  
> “Is that the same car involved in this case?”  
> “Where is it registered?”  
> “Do you reside in Las Vegas?”

### 🎯 *Break the Prosecutor's Chain*
> “Was the Defendant ever on your insurance policy?”  
> “Did you ever give the Defendant permission to drive your vehicle?”  
> “On the night in question, was the Defendant operating or in possession of your vehicle?”

### 💥 *Drop the Investigative Neglect Bomb*
> “Have you ever been contacted by the District Attorney’s Office, LAPD, or any law enforcement agency regarding this vehicle?”  
> “Prior to today, had you ever been asked to give a statement about your ownership or involvement?”  
> “If they had asked, would you have told them this vehicle was yours — not the Defendant’s?”

> 🔥 **Finisher:**
> “So even though your name is on the registration, and your connection to the vehicle destroys the DA’s theory of possession — they never asked you a single question?”

### 💣 Sidebar Strategy Note (For Later Motion or Trial Argument)

> “The People never investigated the actual owner of the vehicle. That’s not just neglect — that’s deliberate investigative concealment. And when that concealment hides the fact that someone *other than the Defendant* owned and controlled the car, it goes to the heart of *reasonable doubt*.”

Things to draft for pre-trail motions:
- A Brady motion supplement based on Antwaun’s non-investigation  
- A trial motion to exclude “possession” references without foundation  
- Or a sidebar objection script to block the DA from claiming knowledge they never investigated
