## 🎙️ DIRECT EXAMINATION – DANNY FITZGERALD  
**Theme**: Reconciliation, manipulation, and no real threat

---

### 🔹 I. Home + Timeline

> “Mr. Fitzgerald, you were the landlord at 6435 Weidlake, correct?”

> “Do you recall leasing that property to me?”

> “Was I up-to-date on rent during the initial part of the lease?”

> “Was the rent approximately $30,000 a month?”

---

### 🔹 II. Miscommunication + Hardy’s Role

> “At some point, did you receive messages or concerns about me from Ms. Hardy?”

> “Did those messages influence how you viewed me at the time?”

> “Was there ever a direct threat made by me toward you?”

> “After we spoke, did we come to an understanding?”

> “Did you describe me as ‘harmless’ during our reconciliation?”

---

### 🔹 III. The Gun + Count 6 (Tie-in)

> “To your knowledge, was a firearm ever presented to you by me?”

> “Did you file any charges? Did you make a 911 call?”

> “Was Count 6 based on an alleged threat or statement you made to the police?”

> “Have you since clarified that the situation was a misunderstanding?”

> “Do you believe I was trying to resolve things peacefully?”

---

### 🔹 IV. Final Framing

> “Do you believe Ms. Hardy may have been manipulating both of us at the time?”

> “Looking back, does it seem like the situation was escalated by her actions and not mine?”

---

## 🎯 Legal Weaponization:

- **Hardy**: Total impeachment — infidelity, lack of evidence, motive to fabricate, use of court as control
- **Fitzgerald**: Undermines probable cause for threats, suppresses Count 6, confirms reconciliation and harmlessness
- **Tie to Franks + Brady**: Both Hardy and Fitzgerald’s post-incident conduct contradicts any true “fear” narrative

Want all of these in a formatted courtroom packet? I can prep them side-by-side with motion anchor labels (Franks, Brady, 995) so you can fire them off one-by-one.
