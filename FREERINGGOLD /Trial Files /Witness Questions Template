Absolutely. Here’s a clean, court-ready **witness question template** you can use for **each of your defense or subpoenaed witnesses**, including Emmanuel Davis and Melissa Paradise. It’s structured for **direct examination** (your own witnesses), and you can copy-paste or handwrite this for each person:

### ✅ III. **Character + Contradictions**
Use this to highlight their truthfulness and any contradictions with police reports:

14. Have you spoken with the police or District Attorney about this case?  
15. Did your account match what is written in the police report?  
16. Do you believe your statements were ignored, misunderstood, or left out?  
17. Are you willing to testify under oath that the statements you just gave are true?

---

### ✅ IV. **Wrap-Up / Summary**
End strong and emphasize your defense theory:

18. Based on what you saw and know, do you believe I committed a crime?  
19. Is there anything else the court or jury should know about what happened that day?

---

## 🔖 Notes:
- Keep it **simple**, **calm**, and let the witness **tell their story**.
- **Do not lead them** with answers. Let them speak freely unless the judge allows leading on minor points.
- If the witness hesitates or forgets, you can say:  
  > “Would it refresh your memory if I showed you your affidavit?”  
  Then show the affidavit or report they signed.
