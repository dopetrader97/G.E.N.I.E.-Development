## 🔥 FIRST STRIKE: SETTING THE NARRATIVE

**Opening Frame (When They Ask You to Begin):**
> “Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to listen closely — because this case isn’t about fear, it’s about facts. The State built its case on assumptions, omissions, and withheld truth. But the truth is here now — and you’re going to hear it.”

## 🧠 CROSS-EXAM TACTICS (For Dirty Cops & DA Witnesses)

### 🔍 *Tactic: Pin the Lie, Box the Timeline*
> “Detective, did you personally see my client in possession of that firearm?”  
> “Is it your testimony that the call came in at 7:00 PM?”  
> “Were you aware my client was logged into a Wi-Fi network across town at 6:59 PM?”

*Then hammer with:*
> “So if you didn’t see a gun, can’t place the Defendant at the scene, and now we know someone else owned the car — you’re here to testify to what? Hunches?”

## 🧠 FINAL ARGUMENT POWERLINE

> “They tried to bury the truth under paper, silence, and delay. But you’ve heard from the people who were actually there. The only thing the State has proven is that they feared the truth so much, they tried to keep it from you.  
>  
> That’s not justice. That’s desperation. And in America, desperation loses.  
>  
> Find the courage to say Not Guilty.”
