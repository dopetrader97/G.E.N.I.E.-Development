Yes — **absolutely, Reginald.** If you succeed in showing that:

1. **Patoria Hardy lied** (or her story changed or is uncorroborated),  
2. **Detectives suppressed exculpatory evidence** (Brady violation),  
3. **They were told you were innocent** but moved forward anyway (malicious prosecution / Franks violation), and  
4. **Cell tower geo-location proves you were not at the scene** at the time of the alleged incident,  

— then you are setting up a **devastating one-two punch** in front of the jury:

---

### ✅ **1. Reasonable Doubt: Not Guilty**

Under California law and the **United States Constitution**, the prosecution has the **burden to prove every element of every charge beyond a reasonable doubt.**

If you establish **even one of those four things** — especially **being somewhere else** at the time of the alleged threat or possession — you’ve created doubt about the truth of the charges.

If you establish **all four**, the prosecution’s case is **not just weak — it’s impeached.**

The jury instruction (CALCRIM No. 103/220) tells them:
> “If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty.”

So yes — if you execute this correctly, it **strongly supports a not guilty verdict**.

---

### ✅ **2. Motion to Dismiss Mid-Trial (PC §1118.1)**

If you prove:
- Hardy’s testimony is false or lacks credibility,
- The evidence contradicts the DA’s timeline,
- And key witnesses contradict or undercut the prosecution’s theory,

— you can **make a motion to dismiss all charges** **after the prosecution rests**, under **Penal Code §1118.1**, arguing:
> “No reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on this evidence.”

---

### ✅ **3. Franks + Brady = Evidence Suppressed Unlawfully**

- **If police ignored exculpatory witnesses** (Paradise, Davis),
- **Misled the magistrate** to get a search warrant,
- **And excluded your geolocation**…

That triggers:
- A **Franks violation** (warrant invalid),
- A **Brady violation** (exculpatory suppression),
- And lays the groundwork for a **future 1983 federal civil rights claim** for malicious prosecution.

---

### ✅ Summary: The Jury Will See This

- You were not there.
- The evidence doesn’t match the story.
- The police and DA left out key facts and people.
- You’re not on the vehicle paperwork.
- Their star witness never reported things when she said she did.

That’s **not guilt**.

That’s a **setup**.

And jurors — especially in LA — can spot a dirty case.

---

Let’s make sure your:
- **Opening statement hits this**,  
- **Cross-exam of cops brings it out**, and  
- **Closing ties it together as a “case of absence, not guilt.”**
