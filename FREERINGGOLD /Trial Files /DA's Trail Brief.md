### 📄 DA’S VERSION OF EVENTS

- On **Nov 13, 2023**, you allegedly:
  - Returned to your former home (6435 Weidlake Dr)
  - Saw Patoria Hardy with new boyfriend (Robert Ri’chard)
  - Confronted and allegedly pulled on her dress
  - Allegedly returned 5 minutes later armed with a gun, saying “I’m going to kill everyone”

- This is the **foundation for the entire firearm + threat narrative** and **leads to the Dec 4 warrant + vehicle search** (BMW 3 Series not registered to you)

- **Vehicle was searched Dec 4** — gun found in bag with alleged ID linking to you

---

### 🧾 PEOPLE’S EXHIBIT LIST INCLUDES:
1. Google Maps of area  
2. Gun photographs  
3. 9-1-1 call (time unknown, needs exact timestamp)  
4. FaceTime video with Fitzgerald  
5. Screenshots of texts  
6. Bodycam footage

### ⚠️ MOTIONS IN LIMINE FILED BY DA

- **Exclude defense witnesses from courtroom** (Evid. Code §777(a))  
- **Block defense from introducing anything not previously disclosed**  
- **Bar your own statements as hearsay unless admitted by the DA**  
- **Prohibit sympathy-based evidence**  
- **Bar you from discussing conviction consequences**  
- **Stop defense witnesses from giving opinions about guilt/innocence**  
- **Prohibit any questioning of Hardy re: past behavior unless evidence exists**

### 🔥 STRATEGY SUMMARY FOR JOHNNY & ROTHSCHILD

1. **Geolocation & Call Logs**:
   - Focus on **Nov 13, 2023**, **7:00–7:45 PM** — **If Reginald was on AT&T towers elsewhere**, that **destroys probable cause** + proves false warrant = *Franks v. Delaware* grounds.

2. **Motions to Exclude** = DA fear:
   - They want to block everything from defense.
   - Highlight that all your witness statements, subpoenas, and discovery responses were timely and on record (motion to **deny MILs as overbroad**).

3. **Gun Not Linked to Reginald**:
   - It was in a **vehicle not owned, registered, or insured by him**.
   - Introduce Antwaun Brown as the registered owner of the BMW.

4. **Affidavit Misconduct**:
   - Davis and Paradise omitted from original warrant affidavit
   - Cell tower data not referenced = **Franks violation**

### 📣 MESSAGE TO JOHNNY & ROTHSCHILD

> This trial brief confirms what we already knew — the DA is trying to control the narrative by cutting off all defense lines. The heart of this case is **Nov 13, 2023**. If we show Reginald was **somewhere else**, and that the warrant was based on omissions and falsehoods, **we flip the case inside out**.  
>  
> This is a **geo-forensic defense**, wrapped in **suppression + Brady + Franks**.  
>  
> We have defense witnesses admitted. The digital alibi + vehicle ownership + missing affidavit info = **total collapse of the DA’s timeline.**

Let me know when you’re ready to:
- Finish and file the EC §1271 motion
- Drop the Franks hearing outline for court
- Finalize your Day 2 game plan for direct & cross

You’re building a clean shot at full acquittal. Let’s move.
