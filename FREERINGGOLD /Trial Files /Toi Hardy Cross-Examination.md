🎙️ CROSS-EXAMINATION – PATORIA HARDY  
**Theme**: Infidelity, false accusation, timeline manipulation, and legal weaponization

---

### 🔹 I. Control of the Narrative

> “Ms. Hardy, you filed for a restraining order shortly after I discovered you with another man in our home, correct?”

> “That man was Robert Ri’chard, a known public figure?”

> “You filed the restraining order within 24 hours of being discovered, correct?”

> “Was that before or after you called the police?”

> “Did you provide any photos, injuries, or medical records to support your allegation?”

---

### 🔹 II. Lease, Rent, and Lifestyle

> “Isn’t it true I was listed on the lease as guarantor for the 6435 Weidlake property?”

> “Did you ever pay rent for that property — or was I covering the full $30,000 a month until I was removed?”

> “Were you aware that while you were staying in the house, I was sleeping out of a storage unit?”

> “You stayed in the home, continued entertaining guests, and removed me — is that right?”

---

### 🔹 III. Relationship with Faith

> “Your daughter Faith had a complicated relationship with you, didn’t she?”

> “She’s tried to run away or live with other relatives before, hasn’t she?”

> “She’s spoken positively about me, hasn’t she?”

---

### 🔹 IV. The Weapon + False Narrative

> “Did you ever personally see me holding a firearm?”

> “Are you aware that no forensic evidence links me to any weapon recovered?”

> “Didn’t the landlord, Danny Fitzgerald, later say this was a misunderstanding and that I was harmless?”

> “You didn’t mention that to the police, did you?”

---

### 🔹 V. Timeline of Alleged Incident vs. 911 Call

> “Ms. Hardy, what time of day did you and I have the encounter you later reported?”

> “Would you agree it happened in the **morning**?”

> “Can you tell the court what time you made the 911 call?”

> “So to be clear: You waited **until nighttime** to report something that allegedly occurred hours earlier?”

> “If you truly felt threatened or in danger, why didn’t you call 911 immediately after the incident?”

> “Was Mr. Ri’chard with you when the incident happened in the morning?”

> “Did he ever call 911 at any time that day?”

> “Did he stay with you in the house after I left?”

> “So no one in the house called the police at the time of the incident — correct?”

> “But then, after you had time to think, **you called later that night**?”

---

### 🔹 VI. FINAL CROSS – CONTROL, MISDIRECTION & FALSE FEAR

> “Ms. Hardy, you contacted the landlord, Danny Fitzgerald, and made certain claims about me, correct?”

> “Those claims led to Danny calling me in a threatening way, didn’t they?”

> “And after Danny called me, you called me to tell me that he was threatening our family, right?”

> “So I was reacting to what you said he was doing — not threatening you directly, correct?”

> “And when you spoke to law enforcement later, you didn’t mention your role in provoking that conflict, did you?”

> “You didn’t tell them what you told Danny. You didn’t tell them you set that exchange up, right?”

---

### 🔹 VII. Closing Blow

> “So just to be clear: I caught you cheating. You filed a restraining order without evidence. You stayed in the house rent-free. You lived with a man wearing my clothes while I was homeless. And now I’m the one on trial. Is that your sworn testimony?”
