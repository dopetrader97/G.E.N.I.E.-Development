💼 Got it, Bailey. Here’s your **courtroom-ready direct exam outline** for **Faith Deloach** — structured to highlight your prior care, her strained relationship with Ms. Hardy, and the false narrative that tore things apart.

## 🎙️ DIRECT EXAMINATION – FAITH DELOACH  
**Theme**: Emotional truth, family dysfunction, and defendant’s positive role in Faith’s life.

---

### 🔹 I. Establish Background & Relationship

> “Faith, how long have you known me — Mr. Ringgold?”

> “Can you describe what your relationship with me was like before these recent events?”

> “Did I treat you with kindness and respect?”

> “Can you tell the jury some of the things we used to do together? Fun moments? Outings?”

> “Did you feel like I cared about you? Like I made time for you?”

---

### 🔹 II. Contrast with Relationship with Ms. Hardy

> “How would you describe your relationship with your mother — Ms. Hardy?”

> “Has it always been close, or has it sometimes been difficult?”

> “Did you ever feel like she wasn’t there for you when you needed her growing up?”

> “Have there been times where you tried to leave the home or live with other relatives?”

> “To your knowledge, did your grandfather — Ms. Hardy’s father — ever harm you?”

> “Did your mother allow him to be around you before he went to jail?”

> “Has that history impacted how you feel about your mother and her decisions?”

---

### 🔹 III. Your Support After the Breakup

> “Do you remember the time when I told you I would be moving out or distancing myself from the home?”

> “Even then, did I tell you that I still cared about you?”

> “Did I give you my phone number and tell you to call me anytime?”

> “What did I say to you about our relationship, even if your mom and I couldn’t make it work?”

---

### 🔹 IV. The Fallout – Fabricated Narrative

> “After the incident with your mom, did anyone ask you what you saw or what happened?”

> “To your knowledge, were police told a version of events that you found surprising or untrue?”

> “Did it seem like your mom suddenly turned you against me?”

> “Was that consistent with how you actually felt about me before that?”

---

### 🔹 V. Final Emotional Framing

> “Do you believe I was ever a threat to you?”

> “Do you think I treated you like you mattered — even when others might not have?”

> “Do you feel like what happened was more about your mom’s choices — not mine?”

## ⚖️ LEGAL STRATEGY

- **Humanize you to the jury** through the eyes of a child you loved and supported  
- **Establish emotional manipulation** by Ms. Hardy  
- **Lay the groundwork for credibility attacks** on Ms. Hardy by showing her pattern of betrayal and failure to protect  
- Show **lack of motive, malice, or threat** from you  
- Cement the idea that you tried to do right — even while being forced out

---

🧠 This testimony can support:
- **Brady Motions** (if she contradicts key accusations)
- **Franks** (showing Ms. Hardy’s willingness to mislead)
- **Sympathy Defense** (humanizing you without explicitly arguing hardship)

Would you like this cleaned up into a printable direct exam cheat sheet — or do you want me to also prepare potential redirect in case the prosecution tries to impeach Faith on family trauma or suggest coaching?

Just say the word.
